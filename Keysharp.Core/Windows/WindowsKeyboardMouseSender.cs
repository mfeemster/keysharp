						// simulated mouse clicks to one of its own windows.  A script consisting only of the
						// following two lines can reproduce this issue:
						// F1::LButton
						// F2::RButton
						// The problems came about from the following sequence of events:
						// 1) Script simulates a left-click-down in the title bar's close, minimize, or maximize button.
						// 2) WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN is sent to the window's window proc, which then passes it on to
						//    DefWindowProc or DefDlgProc, which then apparently enters a loop in which no messages
						//    (or a very limited subset) are pumped.
						// 3) Thus, if the user presses a hotkey while the thread is in this state, that hotkey is
						//    queued/buffered until DefWindowProc/DefDlgProc exits its loop.
						// 4) But the buffered hotkey is the very thing that's supposed to exit the loop via sending a
						//    simulated left-click-up event.
						// 5) Thus, a deadlock occurs.
						// 6) A similar situation arises when a right-click-down is sent to the title bar or sys-menu-icon.
						//
						// The following workaround operates by suppressing qualified click-down events until the
						// corresponding click-up occurs, at which time the click-up is transformed into a down+up if the
						// click-up is still in the same cursor position as the down. It seems preferable to fix this here
						// rather than changing each window proc. to always respond to click-down rather vs. click-up
						// because that would make all of the script's windows behave in a non-standard way, possibly
						// producing side-effects and defeating other programs' attempts to interact with them.
						// (Thanks to Shimanov for this solution.)
						//
						// Remaining known limitations:
						// 1) Title bar buttons are not visibly in a pressed down state when a simulated click-down is sent
						//    to them.
						// 2) A window that should not be activated, such as AlwaysOnTop+Disabled, is activated anyway
						//    by SetForegroundWindowEx().  Not yet fixed due to its rarity and minimal consequences.
						// 3) A related problem for which no solution has been discovered (and perhaps it's too obscure
						//    an issue to justify any added code size): If a remapping such as "F1::LButton" is in effect,
						//    pressing and releasing F1 while the cursor is over a script window's title bar will cause the
						//    window to move slightly the next time the mouse is moved.
						// 4) Clicking one of the script's window's title bar with a key/button that has been remapped to
						//    become the left mouse button sometimes causes the button to get stuck down from the window's
						//    point of view.  The reasons are related to those in #1 above.  In both #1 and #2, the workaround
						//    is not at fault because it's not in effect then.  Instead, the issue is that DefWindowProc enters
						//    a non-msg-pumping loop while it waits for the user to drag-move the window.  If instead the user
						//    releases the button without dragging, the loop exits on its own after a 500ms delay or so.
						// 5) Obscure behavior caused by keyboard's auto-repeat feature: Use a key that's been remapped to
						//    become the left mouse button to click and hold the minimize button of one of the script's windows.
						//    Drag to the left.  The window starts moving.  This is caused by the fact that the down-click is
						//    suppressed, thus the remap's hotkey subroutine thinks the mouse button is down, thus its
						//    auto-repeat suppression doesn't work and it sends another click.

						// Notes about inability of playback to simulate LWin and RWin in a way that performs their native function:
						// For the following reasons, it seems best not to send LWin/RWin via keybd_event inside the playback hook:
						// 1) Complexities such as having to check for an array that consists entirely of LWin/RWin events,
						//    in which case the playback hook mustn't be activated because it requires that we send
						//    at least one event through it.  Another complexity is that all keys modified by Win would
						//    have to be flagged in the array as needing to be sent via keybd_event.
						// 2) It might preserve some flexibility to be able to send LWin/RWin events directly to a window,
						//    similar to ControlSend (perhaps for shells other than Explorer, who might allow apps to make
						//    use of LWin/RWin internally). The window should receive LWIN/RWIN as WM_KEYDOWN messages when
						//    sent via playback.  Note: unlike the neutral SHIFT/ALT/CTRL keys, which are detectible via the
						//    target thread's call to GetKeyState(), LWin and RWin aren't detectible that way.
						// 3) Code size and complexity.
						//
						// Related: LWin and RWin are released and pressed down during playback for simplicity and also
						// on the off-chance the target window takes note of the incoming WM_KEYDOWN on VK_LWIN/RWIN and
						// changes state until the up-event is received (however, the target thread's call of GetKeyState
						// can't see a any effect for hook-sent LWin/RWin).
						//
						// Related: If LWin or RWin is logically down at start of SendPlay, SendPlay's events won't be
						// able to release it from the POV of the target thread's calls to GetKeyState().  That might mess
						// things up for apps that check the logical state of the Win keys.  But due to rarity: in those
						// cases, a workaround would be to do an explicit old-style Send {Blind} (as the first line of the
						// hotkey) to release the modifier logically prior to SendPlay commands.
						//
						// Related: Although some apps might not like receiving SendPlay's LWin/RWin if shell==Explorer
						// (since there may be no normal way for such keystrokes to arrive as WM_KEYDOWN events) maybe it's
						// best not to omit/ignore LWin/RWin if it is possible in other shells, or adds flexibility.
						// After all, sending {LWin/RWin} via hook should be rare, especially if it has no effect (except
						// for cases where a Win hotkey releases LWin as part of SendPlay, but even that can be worked
						// around via an explicit Send {Blind}{LWin up} beforehand).

			// AltGr hotkey from working more than once in a row:
			// <^>!i::Send {ASC 97}
			// Key history indicates it's doing what it should, but it doesn't actually work.  You have to press the

					// 2) The hook will not be present during the SendInput, nor can it be reinstalled in time to

					// 3) Changes made to modifier state by SendPlay are seen only by the active window's thread.
					//    Thus, it would be inconsistent and possibly incorrect to adjust global modifier state
					//    after (or during) a SendPlay.
					// So rather than resorting to A_HotkeyModifierTimeout, we can restore the modifiers within the
					// protection of SendInput/Play's uninterruptibility, allowing the user's buffered keystrokes
					// (if any) to hit against the correct modifier state when the SendInput/Play completes.
					// For example, if #c:: is a hotkey and the user releases Win during the SendInput/Play, that
					// release would hit after SendInput/Play restores Win to the down position, and thus Win would
					// not be stuck down.  Furthermore, if the user didn't release Win, Win would be in the
					// correct/intended position.
					// This approach has a few weaknesses (but the strengths appear to outweigh them):
					// 1) Hitting SendInput's 5000 char limit would omit the tail-end keystrokes, which would mess up
					//    all the assumptions here.  But hitting that limit should be very rare, especially since it's
					//    documented and thus scripts will avoid it.
					// 2) SendInput's assumed uninterruptibility is false if any other app or script has an LL hook
					//    installed.  This too is documented, so scripts should generally avoid using SendInput when
					//    they know there are other LL hooks in the system.  In any case, there's no known solution

			// Notes about modifier key behavior on Windows XP (these probably apply to NT/2k also, and has also

			// released without having modified something (even another modifier), the WIN key will cause the
			// Start Menu to appear, and the ALT key will activate the menu bar of the active window (if it has one).
			// For example, a hook hotkey such as "$#c::Send text" (text must start with a lowercase letter
			// to reproduce the issue, because otherwise WIN would be auto-disguised as a side effect of the SHIFT
			// keystroke) would cause the Start Menu to appear if the disguise method below weren't used.
			//
			// Here are more comments formerly in SetModifierLRStateSpecific(), which has since been eliminated
			// because this function is sufficient:
			// To prevent it from activating the menu bar, the release of the ALT key should be disguised
			// unless a CTRL key is currently down.  This is because CTRL always seems to avoid the
			// activation of the menu bar (unlike SHIFT, which sometimes allows the menu to be activated,
			// though this is hard to reproduce on XP).  Another reason not to use SHIFT is that the OS
			// uses LAlt+Shift as a hotkey to switch languages.  Such a hotkey would be triggered if SHIFT
			// were pressed down to disguise the release of LALT.
			//
			// Alt-down events are also disguised whenever they won't be accompanied by a Ctrl-down.
			// This is necessary whenever our caller does not plan to disguise the key itself.  For example,
			// if "!a::Send Test" is a registered hotkey, two things must be done to avoid complications:
			// 1) Prior to sending the word test, ALT must be released in a way that does not activate the
			//    menu bar.  This is done by sandwiching it between a CTRL-down and a CTRL-up.
			// 2) After the send is complete, SendKeys() will restore the ALT key to the down position if
			//    the user is still physically holding ALT down (this is done to make the logical state of
			//    the key match its physical state, which allows the same hotkey to be fired twice in a row
			//    without the user having to release and press down the ALT key physically).
			// The #2 case above is the one handled below by ctrl_wont_be_down.  It is especially necessary
			// when the user releases the ALT key prior to releasing the hotkey suffix, which would otherwise
			// cause the menu bar (if any) of the active window to be activated.
			//
			// Some of the same comments above for ALT key apply to the WIN key.  More about this issue:
			// Although the disguise of the down-event is usually not needed, it is needed in the rare case
			// where the user releases the WIN or ALT key prior to releasing the hotkey's suffix.
			// Although the hook could be told to disguise the physical release of ALT or WIN in these
			// cases, it's best not to rely on the hook since it is not always installed.
			//
			// Registered WIN and ALT hotkeys that don't use the Send command work okay except ALT hotkeys,
			// which if the user releases ALT prior the hotkey's suffix key, cause the menu bar to be activated.
			// Since it is unusual for users to do this and because it is standard behavior for  ALT hotkeys
			// registered in the OS, fixing it via the hook seems like a low priority, and perhaps isn't worth
			// the added code complexity/size.  But if there is ever a need to do so, the following note applies:
			// If the hook is installed, could tell it to disguise any need-to-be-disguised Alt-up that occurs
			// after receipt of the registered ALT hotkey.  But what if that hotkey uses the send command:
			// there might be interference?  Doesn't seem so, because the hook only disguises non-ignored events.

			// are only sent when necessary (which helps avoid complications caused by keystroke interaction,

				// IMPORTANT UPDATE for v1.0.39: Now that the hooks are in a separate thread from the part

				// keystrokes would become problematic or at least change.  However, this is apparently not
				// the case.  MSDN doesn't spell this out, but testing shows that what happens with a low-level
				// hook is that the moment a keystroke comes into a thread (either physical or simulated), the OS
				// immediately calls something similar to SendMessage() from that thread to notify the hook
				// thread that a keystroke has arrived.  However, if the hook thread's priority is lower than
				// some other thread next in line for a timeslice, it might take some time for the hook thread
				// to get a timeslice (that's why the hook thread is given a high priority).
				// The SendMessage() call doesn't return until its timeout expires (as set in the registry for
				// hooks) or the hook thread processes the keystroke (which requires that it call something like
				// GetMessage/PeekMessage followed by a HookProc "return").  This is good news because it serializes
				// keyboard and mouse input to make the presence of the hook transparent to other threads (unless
				// the hook does something to reveal itself, such as suppressing keystrokes). Serialization avoids
				// any chance of synchronization problems such as a program that changes the state of a key then
				// immediately checks the state of that same key via GetAsyncKeyState().  Another way to look at
				// all of this is that in essence, a single-threaded hook program that simulates keystrokes or
				// mouse clicks should behave the same when the hook is moved into a separate thread because from
				// the program's point-of-view, keystrokes & mouse clicks result in a calling the hook almost
				// exactly as if the hook were in the same thread.

			//  Release shift first.
			// If going down on shift, and control or alt (but not both) is to be released:
			//  Release ctrl/alt first (this is already the case so nothing needs to be done).
			//
			// Release both shifts before going down on lalt/ralt or lctrl/rctrl (but not necessary if going down on
			// *both* alt+ctrl?
			// Release alt and both controls before going down on lshift/rshift.
			// Rather than the below, do the above (for the reason below).
			// But if do this, don't want to prevent a legit/intentional language switch such as:
			//    Send {LAlt down}{Shift}{LAlt up}.
			// If both Alt and Shift are down, Win or Ctrl (or any other key for that matter) must be pressed before either
			// is released.
			// If both Ctrl and Shift are down, Win or Alt (or any other key) must be pressed before either is released.
			// remind: Despite what the Regional Settings window says, RAlt+Shift (and Shift+RAlt) is also a language hotkey (i.e. not just LAlt), at least when RAlt isn't AltGr!
			// remind: Control being down suppresses language switch only once.  After that, control being down doesn't help if lalt is re-pressed prior to re-pressing shift.
			//
			// Language switch occurs when:
			// alt+shift (upon release of shift)
			// shift+alt (upon release of lalt)
			// ctrl+shift (upon release of shift)
			// shift+ctrl (upon release of ctrl)
			// Because language hotkey only takes effect upon release of Shift, it can be disguised via a Control keystroke if that is ever needed.
			// NOTES: More details about disguising ALT and WIN:
			// Registered Alt hotkeys don't quite work if the Alt key is released prior to the suffix.
			// Key history for Alt-B hotkey released this way, which undesirably activates the menu bar:
			// A4  038      d   0.03    Alt
			// 42  030      d   0.03    B
			// A4  038      u   0.24    Alt
			// 42  030      u   0.19    B
			// Testing shows that the above does not happen for a normal (non-hotkey) alt keystroke such as Alt-8,
			// so the above behavior is probably caused by the fact that B-down is suppressed by the OS's hotkey
			// routine, but not B-up.
			// The above also happens with registered WIN hotkeys, but only if the Send cmd resulted in the WIN
			// modifier being pushed back down afterward to match the fact that the user is still holding it down.
			// This behavior applies to ALT hotkeys also.
			// One solution: if the hook is installed, have it keep track of when the start menu or menu bar
			// *would* be activated.  These tracking vars can be consulted by the Send command, and the hook
			// can also be told when to use them after a registered hotkey has been pressed, so that the Alt-up
			// or Win-up keystroke that belongs to it can be disguised.
			// The following are important ways in which other methods of disguise might not be sufficient:
			// Sequence: shift-down win-down shift-up win-up: invokes Start Menu when WIN is held down long enough
			// to auto-repeat.  Same when Ctrl or Alt is used in lieu of Shift.
			// Sequence: shift-down alt-down alt-up shift-up: invokes menu bar.  However, as long as another key,
			// even Shift, is pressed down *after* alt is pressed down, menu bar is not activated, e.g. alt-down
			// shift-down shift-up alt-up.  In addition, CTRL always prevents ALT from activating the menu bar,
			// even with the following sequences:
			// ctrl-down alt-down alt-up ctrl-up
			// alt-down ctrl-down ctrl-up alt-up
			// (also seems true for all other permutations of Ctrl/Alt)
