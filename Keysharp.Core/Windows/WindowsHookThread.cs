				// It's not necessary to link to the multi-threading C runtime (which bloats the code by 3.5 KB
				// compressed) as long as the new thread doesn't call any C-library functions that aren't thread-safe
				// (in addition to the C functions that obviously use static data, calls to things like malloc(),
				// new, and other memory management functions probably aren't thread-safe unless the multi-threaded
				// library is used). The memory leak described in MSDN for ExitThread() applies only to the
				// multi-threaded libraries (multiple sources confirm this), so it isn't a concern either.
				// That's true even if the program is linked against the multi-threaded DLLs (MSVCRT.dll) rather
				// than the libraries (e.g. for a minimum-sized SC.bin file), as confirmed by the following quotes:
				// "This applies only to the static-link version of the runtime. For this and other reasons, I
				// *highly* recommend using the DLL runtime, which lets you use CreateThread() without prejudice.
				// Confirmation from MSDN: "Another work around is to link the *executable* to the CRT in a *DLL*
				// instead of the static CRT."
				//
				// The hooks are designed to make minimal use of C-library calls, currently calling only things
				// like memcpy() and strlen(), which are thread safe in the single-threaded library (according to
				// their source code).  However, the hooks may indirectly call other library functions via calls
				// to KeyEvent() and other functions, which has already been reviewed for thread-safety but needs
				// to be kept in mind as changes are made in the future.
				//
				// CreateThread's second parameter is the new thread's initial stack size. The stack will grow
				// automatically if more is needed, so it's kept small here to greatly reduce the amount of
				// memory used by the hook thread.  The XP Task Manager's "VM Size" column (which seems much
				// more accurate than "Mem Usage") indicates that a new thread consumes 28 KB + its stack size.

					// The above priority level seems optimal because if some other process has high priority,
					// the keyboard and mouse hooks will still take precedence, which avoids the mouse cursor
					// and keystroke lag that would otherwise occur (confirmed through testing).  Due to their
					// return-ASAP nature, the hooks are an ideal candidate for almost-realtime priority because
					// they run only rarely and only for tiny bursts of time.
					// Note that the above must also be done in such a way that it works on NT4, which doesn't support
					// below-normal and above-normal process priorities, nor perhaps other aspects of priority.
					// So what is the actual priority given to the hooks by the OS?  Assuming that the script's
					// process is set to NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS (which is the default), the following applies:
					// First of all, a definition: "base priority" is the actual/net priority of the thread.
					// It determines how the OS will schedule a thread relative to all other threads on the system.
					// So in a sense, if you look only at base priority, the thread's process's priority has no
					// bearing on how the thread will get scheduled (except to the extent that it contributes
					// to the calculation of the base priority itself).  Here are some common base priorities
					// along with where the hook priority (15) fits in:
					// 7 = NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS process + THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL thread.
					// 9 = NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS process + THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST thread.
					// 13 = HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS process + THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL thread.
					// 15 = (ANY)_PRIORITY_CLASS process + THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL thread. <-- Seems like the optimal compromise.
					// 15 = HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS process + THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST thread.
					// 24 = REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS process + THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL thread.

			//  return OK;
			//is_running = true; // Since we're exiting, there should be no need to set it to false further below.
			// If it times out I think it's realistically impossible that the new thread really exists because
			// if it did, it certainly would have had time to execute GetMessage() in all but extreme/theoretical
			// cases.  Therefore, no thread check/termination attempt is done.  Alternatively, a check for
			// GetExitCodeThread() could be done followed by closing the handle and setting it to NULL, but once
			// again the code size doesn't seem worth it for a situation that is probably impossible.
			//
			// Also, a timeout itself seems too rare (perhaps even impossible) to justify a warning dialog.

			// is about to exit the app via exit(), which otherwise might not cleanly close all threads).

			// SUMMARY OF DEAD KEY ISSUE:
			// Calling ToUnicodeEx() with conventional parameters disrupts the entry of dead keys in two different ways:
			//  1) Passing a dead key buffers it within the keyboard layout's internal state.
			//  2) Passing a live key removes any pending dead key from the keyboard layout's internal state.
			// In either case, the state is then incorrect for the active window's own call to ToUnicodeEx(), so it ends
			// up with something like "e" or "''e" instead of "é".  Originally this was solved by reinserting the pending
			// dead key (first by re-sending the dead key, then later by calling ToUnicodeEx()), but now we use a special
			// combination of parameters to avoid changing the state where possible.

			// Univeral Windows Platform apps apparently have their own handling for dead keys:
			//  - On some OS versions, dead key followed by Esc produces Chr(27), unlike non-UWP apps.
			//  - Pressing a dead key in a UWP app does not leave it in the keyboard layout's buffer,
			//    so to get the correct result here we must translate the dead key again, first.
			//  - Pressing a non-dead key disregards any dead key which was placed into the buffer by
			//    calling ToUnicodeEx, and it is left in the buffer.  To get the correct result for the
			//    next call, the dead key must NOT be left in the buffer.
			//  - Chained dead keys reportedly do not work even without AutoHotkey interfering, but in
			//    case that's fixed (and for simplicity), our translation assumes that it will work.
			// Note that this still applies to some apps on Windows 11 22H2 (such as Feedback Hub) but
			// does not apply to newer apps based on WinUI, such as the Photos app.

						// when XP Theme (but not classic theme) is in effect:
						//#InstallMouseHook
						//Gui, +AlwaysOnTop
						//Gui, Show, w200 h100
						//return
						// The problem came about from the following sequence of events:
						// 1) User clicks the one of the script's window's title bar's close, minimize, or maximize button.
						// 2) WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN is sent to the window's window proc, which then passes it on to
						//    DefWindowProc or DefDlgProc, which then apparently enters a loop in which no messages
						//    (or a very limited subset) are pumped.
						// 3) If anyone sends a message to that window (such as GetWindowText(), which sends a message
						//    in cases where it doesn't have the title pre-cached), the message will not receive a reply
						//    until after the mouse button is released.
						// 4) But the hook is the very thing that's supposed to release the mouse button, and it can't
						//    until a reply is received.
						// 5) Thus, a deadlock occurs.  So after a short but noticeable delay, the OS sees the hook as
						//    unresponsive and bypasses it, sending the click through normally, which breaks the deadlock.
						// 6) A similar situation might arise when a right-click-down is sent to the title bar or
						//    sys-menu-icon.
						//
						// SOLUTION:
						// Post the message to our main thread to have it do the GetWindowText call.  That way, if
						// the target window is one of the main thread's own window's, there's no chance it can be
						// in an unresponsive state like the deadlock described above.  In addition, do this for ALL
						// windows because its simpler, more maintainable, and especially might solve other hook
						// performance problems if GetWindowText() has other situations where it is slow to return
						// (which seems likely).
						// Although the above solution could create rare situations where there's a lag before window text
						// is updated, that seems unlikely to be common or have significant consequences.  Furthermore,
						// it has the advantage of improving hook performance by avoiding the call to GetWindowText (which
						// incidentally might solve hotkey lag problems that have been observed while the active window
						// is momentarily busy/unresponsive -- but maybe not because the main thread would then be lagged
						// instead of the hook thread, which is effectively the same result from user's POV).
						// Note: It seems best not to post the message to the hook thread because if LButton is down,
						// the hook's main event loop would be sending a message to an unresponsive thread (our main thread),
						// which would create the same deadlock.
						// ALTERNATE SOLUTIONS:
						// - #1: Avoid calling GetWindowText at all when LButton or RButton is in a logically-down state.
						// - Same as #1, but do so only if one of the main thread's target windows is known to be in a tight loop (might be too unreliable to detect all such cases).
						// - Same as #1 but less rigorous and more catch-all, such as by checking if the active window belongs to our thread.
						// - Avoid calling GetWindowText at all upon release of LButton.
						// - Same, but only if the window to have text retrieved belongs to our process.
						// - Same, but only if the mouse is inside the close/minimize/etc. buttons of the active window.

				//    when its first qualified physical down-event came in.  This is definitely better but like
				//    #1, the uncertainty of breaking existing scripts and/or causing more harm than good seems too
				//    high.
