				// v1.0.40.01: The following section corrects misbehavior caused by a thread sending
				// simulated mouse clicks to one of its own windows.  A script consisting only of the
				// following two lines can reproduce this issue:
				// F1::LButton
				// F2::RButton
				// The problems came about from the following sequence of events:
				// 1) Script simulates a left-click-down in the title bar's close, minimize, or maximize button.
				// 2) WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN is sent to the window's window proc, which then passes it on to
				//    DefWindowProc or DefDlgProc, which then apparently enters a loop in which no messages
				//    (or a very limited subset) are pumped.
				// 3) Thus, if the user presses a hotkey while the thread is in this state, that hotkey is
				//    queued/buffered until DefWindowProc/DefDlgProc exits its loop.
				// 4) But the buffered hotkey is the very thing that's supposed to exit the loop via sending a
				//    simulated left-click-up event.
				// 5) Thus, a deadlock occurs.
				// 6) A similar situation arises when a right-click-down is sent to the title bar or sys-menu-icon.
				//
				// The following workaround operates by suppressing qualified click-down events until the
				// corresponding click-up occurs, at which time the click-up is transformed into a down+up if the
				// click-up is still in the same cursor position as the down. It seems preferable to fix this here
				// rather than changing each window proc. to always respond to click-down rather vs. click-up
				// because that would make all of the script's windows behave in a non-standard way, possibly
				// producing side-effects and defeating other programs' attempts to interact with them.
				// (Thanks to Shimanov for this solution.)
				//
				// Remaining known limitations:
				// 1) Title bar buttons are not visibly in a pressed down state when a simulated click-down is sent
				//    to them.
				// 2) A window that should not be activated, such as AlwaysOnTop+Disabled, is activated anyway
				//    by SetForegroundWindowEx().  Not yet fixed due to its rarity and minimal consequences.
				// 3) A related problem for which no solution has been discovered (and perhaps it's too obscure
				//    an issue to justify any added code size): If a remapping such as "F1::LButton" is in effect,
				//    pressing and releasing F1 while the cursor is over a script window's title bar will cause the
				//    window to move slightly the next time the mouse is moved.
				// 4) Clicking one of the script's window's title bar with a key/button that has been remapped to
				//    become the left mouse button sometimes causes the button to get stuck down from the window's
				//    point of view.  The reasons are related to those in #1 above.  In both #1 and #2, the workaround
				//    is not at fault because it's not in effect then.  Instead, the issue is that DefWindowProc enters
				//    a non-msg-pumping loop while it waits for the user to drag-move the window.  If instead the user
				//    releases the button without dragging, the loop exits on its own after a 500ms delay or so.
				// 5) Obscure behavior caused by keyboard's auto-repeat feature: Use a key that's been remapped to
				//    become the left mouse button to click and hold the minimize button of one of the script's windows.
				//    Drag to the left.  The window starts moving.  This is caused by the fact that the down-click is
				//    suppressed, thus the remap's hotkey subroutine thinks the mouse button is down, thus its
				//    auto-repeat suppression doesn't work and it sends another click.

						// Notes about inability of playback to simulate LWin and RWin in a way that performs their native function:

						// 1) Complexities such as having to check for an array that consists entirely of LWin/RWin events,
						//    in which case the playback hook mustn't be activated because it requires that we send
						//    at least one event through it.  Another complexity is that all keys modified by Win would
						//    have to be flagged in the array as needing to be sent via keybd_event.
						// 2) It might preserve some flexibility to be able to send LWin/RWin events directly to a window,
						//    similar to ControlSend (perhaps for shells other than Explorer, who might allow apps to make
						//    use of LWin/RWin internally). The window should receive LWIN/RWIN as WM_KEYDOWN messages when
						//    sent via playback.  Note: unlike the neutral SHIFT/ALT/CTRL keys, which are detectible via the
						//    target thread's call to GetKeyState(), LWin and RWin aren't detectible that way.
						// 3) Code size and complexity.
						//
						// Related: LWin and RWin are released and pressed down during playback for simplicity and also
						// on the off-chance the target window takes note of the incoming WM_KEYDOWN on VK_LWIN/RWIN and
						// changes state until the up-event is received (however, the target thread's call of GetKeyState
						// can't see a any effect for hook-sent LWin/RWin).
						//
						// Related: If LWin or RWin is logically down at start of SendPlay, SendPlay's events won't be
						// able to release it from the POV of the target thread's calls to GetKeyState().  That might mess
						// things up for apps that check the logical state of the Win keys.  But due to rarity: in those
						// cases, a workaround would be to do an explicit old-style Send {Blind} (as the first line of the
						// hotkey) to release the modifier logically prior to SendPlay commands.
						//
						// Related: Although some apps might not like receiving SendPlay's LWin/RWin if shell==Explorer
						// (since there may be no normal way for such keystrokes to arrive as WM_KEYDOWN events) maybe it's
						// best not to omit/ignore LWin/RWin if it is possible in other shells, or adds flexibility.
						// After all, sending {LWin/RWin} via hook should be rare, especially if it has no effect (except
						// for cases where a Win hotkey releases LWin as part of SendPlay, but even that can be worked
						// around via an explicit Send {Blind}{LWin up} beforehand).

				// If the key is being held down, sending a KEYDOWNANDUP won't change its toggle
				// state unless the key is "released" first.  This has been confirmed for NumLock,
				// CapsLock and ScrollLock on Windows 2000 (in a VM) and Windows 10.
				// Examples where problems previously occurred:
				//   ~CapsLock & x::Send abc  ; Produced "ABC"
				//   ~CapsLock::Send abc  ; Alternated between "abc" and "ABC", even without {Blind}
				//   ~ScrollLock::SetScrollLockState Off  ; Failed to change state
				// The behavior can still be observed by sending the keystrokes manually:
				//   ~NumLock::Send {NumLock}  ; No effect
				//   ~NumLock::Send {NumLock up}{NumLock}  ; OK
				// OLD COMMENTS:
				// Sending an extra up-event first seems to prevent the problem where the Numlock
				// key's indicator light doesn't change to reflect its true state (and maybe its
				// true state doesn't change either).  This problem tends to happen when the key
				// is pressed while the hook is forcing it to be either ON or OFF (or it suppresses
				// it because it's a hotkey).  Needs more testing on diff. keyboards & OSes:
