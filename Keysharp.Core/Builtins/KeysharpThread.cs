	/// One cooperative script thread — what AutoHotkey calls a "thread", as opposed to the real operating-system
	/// threads that <see cref="Ks.RealThread"/> describes. The current one is <c>A_Thread</c>; the ones beneath it
	/// are reached through <see cref="Underlying"/>, and the whole stack of a real thread through
	/// <c>RealThread.Threads</c>. This is the extension point for per-thread facts, which is why they live here
	/// instead of becoming one importable <c>A_*</c> global each.
	/// <para>
	/// Scripts know this class as <c>Thread</c>, and calling it runs the AutoHotkey <c>Thread</c> function
	/// (<see cref="staticCall"/>) — <c>Thread "NoTimers"</c>, <c>Thread "Priority", n</c>, <c>Thread "Interrupt", n</c>
	/// — so one name covers the thread settings and the thread object. The CLR type keeps a distinct name because
	/// <c>Thread</c> is taken by <see cref="System.Threading.Thread"/>, the same reason <c>Func</c> is
	/// <c>KeysharpFunc</c>.</para>
	/// <para>
	/// Thread state is pooled and reused (see <see cref="ThreadVariableManager"/>), so every wrapper captures the ID
	/// of the thread it was made for and re-checks it on each access. Once that thread ends the wrapper reports
	/// <see cref="IsActive"/> false; <see cref="Id"/> and <see cref="Index"/> keep answering from captured values and
	/// everything else throws <c>TargetError</c>, rather than silently describing whichever thread reused the
	/// slot.</para>
	/// <para>
	/// Exactly one wrapper exists per thread, so identity comparison answers "is this the one I am in":
	/// <c>thr == A_Thread</c>. There is deliberately no <c>IsCurrent</c> property for that.</para>
	/// <para>
	/// A wrapper may be read from any real thread, but only its owner may change it: every setter and
	/// <see cref="Exit"/> throw <c>TargetError</c> elsewhere. That is the same restriction targeted <c>Exit()</c>
	/// always had, enforced by the object instead of by an error return.</para>
