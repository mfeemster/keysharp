				// 1) A joystick hotkey from TriggerJoyHotkeys(), in which case the lParam is ignored.
				// 2) A hotkey message sent by the OS, in which case lParam contains currently-unused info set by the OS.
				//
				// An incoming WM_HOTKEY can be subject to #HotIf Win. at this stage under the following conditions:
				// 1) Joystick hotkey, because it relies on us to do the check so that the check is done only
				//    once rather than twice.
				// 2) #HotIf Win. keybd hotkeys that were made non-hook because they have a non-suspended, global variant.
				//
				// If message is AHK_HOOK_HOTKEY:
				// Rather than having the hook pass the qualified variant to us, it seems preferable
				// to search through all the criteria again and rediscover it.  This is because conditions
				// may have changed since the message was posted, and although the hotkey might still be
				// eligible for firing, a different variant might now be called for (e.g. due to a change
				// in the active window).  Since most criteria hotkeys have at most only a few criteria,
				// and since most such criteria are #HotIf WinActive rather than Exist, the performance will
				// typically not be reduced much at all.  Furthermore, trading performance for greater
				// reliability seems worth it in this case.
				//
				// The inefficiency of calling HotCriterionAllowsFiring() twice for each hotkey --
				// once in the hook and again here -- seems justified for the following reasons:
				// - It only happens twice if the hotkey a hook hotkey (multi-variant keyboard hotkeys
				//   that have a global variant are usually non-hook, even on NT/2k/XP).
				// - The hook avoids doing its first check of WinActive/Exist if it sees that the hotkey
				//   has a non-suspended, global variant.  That way, hotkeys that are hook-hotkeys for
				//   reasons other than #HotIf Win. (such as mouse, overriding OS hotkeys, or hotkeys
				//   that are too fancy for RegisterHotkey) will not have to do the check twice.
				// - It provides the ability to set the last-found-window for #HotIf WinActive/Exist
				//   (though it's not needed for the "Not" counterparts).  This HWND could be passed
				//   via the message, but that would require malloc-there and free-here, and might
				//   result in memory leaks if its ever possible for messages to get discarded by the OS.
				// - It allows hotkeys that were eligible for firing at the time the message was
				//   posted but that have since become ineligible to be aborted.  This seems like a
				//   good precaution for most users/situations because such hotkey subroutines will
				//   often assume (for scripting simplicity) that the specified window is active or
				//   exists when the subroutine executes its first line.
				// - Most criterion hotkeys use #HotIf WinActive(), which is a very fast call.  Also, although
				//   WinText and/or "SetTitleMatchMode 'Slow'" slow down window searches, those are rarely
				//   used too.
