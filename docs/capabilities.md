Generated from docs/capabilities.json via scripts/generate-capabilities.ps1.

Status legend:
- 🟢 Full: Implemented and generally usable
- 🟡 Partial: Implemented with known limitations or gaps
- 🟠 Planned: Not implemented yet, but intended
- 🔴 Unsupported: Not supported
- ⚪ Unknown: Not yet verified
- `Partial*` on non-Windows `Control*()` functions means script-owned Keysharp controls are supported, but controls in foreign applications are not.

| Capability | Windows | Linux (X11) | Linux (Wayland) | macOS | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| - | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Subtraction / unary minus operator |
| -- | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Decrement operator |
| ! | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Logical NOT operator |
| !~= | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Regular-expression not-match operator. |
| != | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Inequality operator |
| !== | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Strict inequality operator. |
| #App | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Keysharp-only descriptor for assembly metadata, Icon, GuiTheme, ConsoleApp, HookMutexName, Linux DesktopEntry and Files; multiple blocks merge independently by key in source order, later keys win, and Files: [] clears the list. DesktopEntry selects the Linux desktop file, Wayland app_id and Taskbar target unless DESKTOP_ENTRY overrides it. Asset paths are main-script-relative logical paths and artifact builds embed Files. |
| #ClipboardTimeout | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Sets how long clipboard operations should wait before timing out. |
| #CSharp | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | ⚪ Unknown | ⚪ Unknown | Keysharp-only. Embeds C# members into the script assembly at module or class scope; `#CSharp <Library>` uses #Include's Lib-folder search order, `.cs` extension and underscore fallback. |
| #Define | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Defines a conditional compilation symbol. |
| #DllLoad | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The #DllLoad directive loads a DLL or EXE file before the script starts executing. |
| #ElIf | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Adds an alternate conditional compilation branch. |
| #Else | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Adds a fallback branch in a conditional compilation block. |
| #EndIf | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Ends a conditional compilation block. |
| #EndRegion | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Accepted; a source-folding marker with no runtime semantics. |
| #Error | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Emits the given message as a compile-time diagnostic. |
| #ErrorStdOut | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Standalone directive that sends subsequent load-time errors and uncaught runtime errors to standard error instead of displaying a dialog. The command-line switch applies to load-time errors from the start of loading. |
| #HotIf | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The #HotIf directive creates context-sensitive hotkeys and hotstrings. They perform a different action (or none at all) depending on any condition (an expression). |
| #HotIfTimeout | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The #HotIfTimeout directive sets the maximum time that may be spent evaluating a single #HotIf expression. |
| #Hotstring | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The #Hotstring directive changes hotstring options or ending characters. |
| #If | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Begins a conditional compilation block. |
| #Import | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Imports a module object and/or names from another module or script file. Module globals are implicitly available for wildcard import; imported aliases are re-exported only with #Import Export. Wildcards exclude names beginning with underscore, while explicit imports may name them. Bare unquoted imports and `as` aliases bind the module object; there are no default exports. Keysharp extension: an #Import inside a function, method, property or class body binds names lexically to that scope (AutoHotkey binds them module-wide); module loading and execution order remain eager. |
| #Include | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The #Include and #IncludeAgain directives cause the script to behave as though the specified file's contents are present at this exact position. Path separators are platform-independent: a backslash in an #Include, #Import or #CSharp path separates directories on Linux and macOS too, so `#Include Lib\Thing.ahk` resolves everywhere. |
| #IncludeAgain | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The #Include and #IncludeAgain directives cause the script to behave as though the specified file's contents are present at this exact position. Path separators are platform-independent: a backslash in an #Include, #Import or #CSharp path separates directories on Linux and macOS too, so `#Include Lib\Thing.ahk` resolves everywhere. |
| #InputLevel | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The #InputLevel directive controls which artificial keyboard and mouse events are ignored by hotkeys and hotstrings. |
| #Line | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Accepted; line/file override for diagnostics is a no-op. |
| #MaxThreads | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The #MaxThreads directive sets the maximum number of simultaneous threads. |
| #MaxThreadsBuffer | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The #MaxThreadsBuffer directive causes some or all hotkeys to buffer rather than ignore keypresses when their #MaxThreadsPerHotkey limit has been reached. |
| #MaxThreadsPerHotkey | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The #MaxThreadsPerHotkey directive sets the maximum number of simultaneous threads per hotkey or hotstring. |
| #Module | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The #Module directive starts a new module or reopens an existing module. |
| #NoTrayIcon | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Disables the startup tray icon. #NoTrayIcon and #TrayIcon apply in source order, so the later directive determines visibility. |
| #Nullable | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Accepted; nullable-context state is a no-op in Keysharp. |
| #Package | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | ⚪ Unknown | ⚪ Unknown | Keysharp-only. Resolves NuGet packages at compile time for Clr and inline C#. Supports managed, resource and native assets, but not package build hooks. Windows verified. |
| #Pragma | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Accepted; preprocessor pragma options are a no-op. |
| #Region | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Accepted; a source-folding marker with no runtime semantics. |
| #Requires | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The #Requires directive displays an error and quits if a version requirement is not met. |
| #SingleInstance | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The #SingleInstance directive determines whether a script is allowed to run again when it is already running. |
| #StructPack | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Sets the maximum alignment for subsequent typed struct fields. |
| #SuspendExempt | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The #SuspendExempt directive exempts subsequent hotkeys and hotstrings from suspension. |
| #TrayIcon | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Keysharp-only standalone directive that selects the script's embedded tray default; #TrayIcon and #NoTrayIcon apply in source order, and bare #TrayIcon restores the #App Icon or Keysharp default. FileName is main-script-relative; omitted, positive, negative and quoted-string selectors mean the first group, a 1-based group, a native resource ID or a managed resource name, respectively, and native-module selection is Windows-only. |
| #Undef | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Undefines a conditional compilation symbol. |
| #UseHook | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The #UseHook directive forces the use of the hook to implement all or some keyboard hotkeys. |
| #Warn | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Enables warnings (VarUnset, Unreachable, LocalSameAsGlobal, NamedArg); VarUnset, Unreachable and NamedArg are on by default. |
| #Warn NamedArg | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Keysharp extension. Checks a named argument against the callee's signature at build time when the callee is a bare name. On by default; dispatch is by value at run time so it is a warning, and the binder re-checks and throws. |
| #Warning | 🟠 Planned | 🟠 Planned | 🟠 Planned | 🟠 Planned | Intended to emit a compile-time warning message. No handler exists, so using it is a load-time error. Distinct from #Warn, which is implemented. |
| #WinActivateForce | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The #WinActivateForce directive skips the gentle method of activating a window and goes straight to the forceful method. |
| %...% / Dereference | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Performs dynamic dereferencing (double-deref) to resolve a variable name stored in another variable. |

| A_PriorHotkey | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Built-in variable. |
| A_Priority | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets or sets the running thread's priority; equivalent to `Thread "Priority", n`. Every thread starts at 0; there is no settable process-wide default. |
| A_PriorKey | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Built-in variable. |
| A_ProcessArch | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | CPU architecture of the running process: X64, ARM64, X86 or ARM, matching the preprocessor symbol of the same name. Branch on this rather than A_PtrSize for interop, since A_PtrSize is 8 for both X64 and ARM64. |

| A_TickCount | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The number of milliseconds since the system started. Note this is not limited to 49.7 days like AHK because it uses a long integer. |
| A_TimeIdle | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Milliseconds since the last input. Linux uses keysharp-input’s compositor-independent device activity counter. |

| A_TimeSinceThisHotkey | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Built-in variable. |
| A_TitleMatchMode | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Sets or returns 1 for matching the start of a title, 2 for matching anywhere in a title, 3 for matching exactly a title, or "RegEx" for matching using a regular expression. |
| A_TitleMatchModeSpeed | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Sets or returns "Fast" for fast window title matching, or "Slow" for slow window title matching. |
| A_TrayMenu | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Built-in variable. |

| and | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Logical AND operator. |
| Any | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Special type value that can match any type. |
| App | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The running application as a class: Name, Title, Description, Configuration, Company, Product, Copyright, Trademark and Version report the assembly metadata the matching #App key sets, CommandLine reports the process command line, and ExitReason/ExitCode report an exit in progress to code that is not an OnExit callback. Every member is read-only, and an undeclared key reads as an empty string in both compatibility modes. Replaces the removed A_Assembly*, A_CommandLine and A_HasExited variables. |
| Array | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Ordered collection object. |
| Array.__Enum() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Enumerates array elements. |
| Array.__Item | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Indexer property for getting or setting array elements. |
| Array.__New() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Constructs a new Array object. |
| Array.Capacity | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets or sets the reserved element capacity. |
| Array.Clone() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns a shallow copy of an array. |
| Array.Contains() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Keysharp-specific Array method. Omitting the value searches for an element which has no value. |
| Array.Default | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Default value returned for missing indexes. |
| Array.Delete() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Sets the element at the specified index to null, returns the element at that index before it was cleared. |
| Array.Filter() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns a new array containing elements accepted by a callback predicate. |
| Array.FindIndex() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns the index of the first element matching a callback predicate. |
| Array.Get() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets the value at an index with optional fallback default. |
| Array.Has() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns whether an array contains a non-empty value at the given index. |
| Array.IndexOf() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns the index of the first occurrence of a value. Omitting the value searches for an element which has no value. An out of bounds StartIndex (0, or an absolute value exceeding the length) throws an IndexError, like the sibling FindIndex; an empty array returns 0. |
| Array.InsertAt() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Inserts an element or range of elements at a given index. |
| Array.Join() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Joins array elements into a string with a separator. |
| Array.Length | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets/sets the logical length of the array. |
| Array.MapTo() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns a new array transformed by a callback. |
| Array.MaxIndex() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns the largest integer contained in the array. Returns empty string if no integers are present. |
| Array.MinIndex() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns the smallest integer contained in the array. Returns empty string if no integers are present. |
| Array.Pop() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Removes and returns the last element of an array. An exception is thrown if the array was empty. |
| Array.Push() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Appends values to the end of an array. |
| Array.Remove() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Keysharp-specific Array method. Removes the first occurrence of the value and returns true if one was found and removed, else false. Omitting the value removes the first element which has no value. |
| Array.RemoveAt() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Removes the element at a given index, plus optionally a length. Returns the removed item if no length was specified. Returns the null if a length was specified. |
| Array.Sort() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Sorts array elements, optionally using a custom comparer callback. |
| Array.ToClr() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The array as a Ks.Clr object, exposing its full CLR surface late-bound. An Array is itself a CLR IList, so .NET APIs declaring one accept it directly. |
| Asin() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Computes the arc sine. Throws an exception if the argument value is not between -1 and 1. |
| Atan() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Computes the arc tangent. |
| ATan2() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Computes the arc tangent by using two numbers. |
| Audio | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | ⚪ Unknown | 🟠 Planned | Keysharp-specific Ks class for cross-platform audio: polyphonic playback from files or memory through a managed mixer, device discovery, endpoint volume and mute, per-application sessions, level meters and recording. Independent of the AHK Sound* functions, which keep their own fuzzy device selector and monophonic file playback. Windows uses WASAPI and is verified on hardware; the Linux libpulse backend compiles and has been exercised against a real PulseAudio server for enumeration, playback and recording; macOS AudioQueue compiles against the contracts but has never been run. |
| Audio.Clip / Audio.Load() / Audio.FromPcm() | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟠 Planned | An immutable decoded sound. Load() reads a file and FromPcm() copies headerless bytes out of a Buffer, so the caller may reuse its buffer immediately. Only WAV is decoded without a platform codec: little-endian RIFF carrying 8/16/24/32-bit integer or float32 PCM, mono or stereo, 8 through 192 kHz. Every other container is refused by name rather than played as noise; IsFormatSupported() reports what this host can actually decode. |
| Audio.Device.IsRunning | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | ⚪ Unknown | 🟠 Planned | Returns a Boolean indicating whether any application holds a live stream, including silent streams. False includes idle, unknown and missing devices; use Status to distinguish them. macOS may not track Bluetooth inputs. |
| Audio.Device.Status | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | ⚪ Unknown | 🟠 Planned | Reports Running, Idle, Unknown or Missing. Unknown means activity cannot be determined; Missing means removal was observed. |
| Audio.Device.ToClr() / Audio.Session.ToClr() | 🟢 Full | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | 🟠 Planned | The platform's own device or session object, for the Core Audio surface this class does not model such as ducking, per-channel volume and endpoint form factor. Its concrete type is platform-dependent and unspecified, and work done through it bypasses this class's caching. PulseAudio exposes no object of comparable reach, so Linux raises an actionable OSError instead. |
| Audio.Device.Volume / Audio.Device.Mute | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | ⚪ Unknown | 🟠 Planned | The endpoint's own volume from 0 through 100 and its mute state, operated on an exactly identified device rather than through the SoundSetVolume name match. Out-of-range input raises a ValueError rather than being clamped. Windows uses IAudioEndpointVolume, Linux the libpulse sink and source controls, macOS the Core Audio virtual master volume. |
| Audio.Devices() / Audio.DefaultDevice() / Audio.Device | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | ⚪ Unknown | 🟠 Planned | Lists present input and output endpoints. Devices expose an opaque Id, Name, Kind, Status, IsRunning, IsDefault and Refresh(); selection uses the exact Id. |
| Audio.Meter | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | ⚪ Unknown | 🟠 Planned | An explicit lifetime for observing a device or session level, because metering a target whose frames do not pass through Keysharp costs a live native stream on some backends. Peak is 0 through 100, or blank before any observation completed, so no data stays distinct from digital silence. Output, playback and recorder Peak need no meter, since Keysharp already owns those frames. |
| Audio.OnDeviceChange() | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | ⚪ Unknown | 🟠 Planned | Fires callback(hook, kind, device) when a device is added, removed, renamed or becomes the default, where kind is "Added", "Removed", "Changed" or "DefaultChanged". Returns the shared Ks.EventHook, so Status, IsActive, Count, Paused, Pause and Stop behave exactly as they do for WinEvent and Monitor.OnChange. The subscription is rooted until Stop, count exhaustion or script teardown, so dropping the handle does not unsubscribe it. |
| Audio.Output / Audio.Playback / Audio.Play() | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | ⚪ Unknown | 🟠 Planned | Many sounds at once through one managed float32 mixer and one native stream, which is what SoundPlay cannot do. After Open() and Prepare() a play performs no decode, resample or blocking call, so it is safe from a frame timer. Each admitted play returns a stable Audio.Playback with Volume, Pan, Loop, Mute, PositionMilliseconds, Pause, Resume and Stop; a bounded refusal returns blank rather than raising. VoicePolicy is "Oldest", "RoundRobin" or "Reject". One script may hold 16 outputs open. |
| Audio.Recorder / Audio.Recording | ⚪ Unknown | ⚪ Unknown | ⚪ Unknown | 🟠 Planned | Captures a microphone or what an output device is playing, to a WAV file or to memory. Configured first and started second so handlers can be registered before capture begins and a permission failure is observable. A recorder is single-use once capture is admitted, and every way it can end competes for one terminal transition, so exactly one reason and one result are published. Capture is gated on the AudioCapture permission strictly, rather than the usual log-and-continue. Implemented on all three backends but not yet exercised on hardware; macOS system-output capture is unsupported pending its process-tap spike. |
| Audio.Sessions() / Audio.Session / Audio.SetApplicationVolume() | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | ⚪ Unknown | 🔴 Unsupported | Per-application volume and mute. A session snapshot is generation-bound and expires rather than rebinding, so a handle kept across an application restart never silently controls the newcomer. One process routinely owns several sessions, so every match is returned and the bulk setters report how many they changed. macOS exposes no public per-application audio model and reports IsSessionControlSupported false. |
| Await() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Waits for a Task, a RealThread, a CLR task or value task, or an object implementing __Await(), and returns its value. Blocks the calling pseudo-thread while pumping everything else, like Sleep, so it is an interruption point rather than a suspension. Timing out does not cancel the work. |
| Base | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Retrieves the value's base object. |
| Base64.Decode() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Decodes Base64 text to a Buffer. |
| Base64.Encode() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Encodes binary data as Base64 text. |
| BlockInput() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Disables or enables physical keyboard and mouse input while allowing synthetic input. Full On blocking requires InputControl; movement-only blocking uses an observing and suppressing hook, so it requires both InputMonitoring and InputControl. Off and teardown never request permission. Linux uses keysharp-input and fails closed if that authority is unavailable or revokes access. macOS uses event taps. |
| Boolean | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The type of a truth value, extending Integer, so it reads as 1 or 0 everywhere except a type test. Boolean(Value) converts a value the way `if` decides it. |
| Break | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Exits the current loop. |
| Buffer() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The Buffer object encapsulates a block of memory for use with advanced techniques such as DllCall, structures, StrPut and raw file I/O. |
| Buffer.__Item[] | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Indexer for reading/writing bytes in Buffer by offset. |
| Buffer.__New() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Constructs a new Buffer object. |
| CallbackCreate() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Creates a native callback address which redirects to a script function. Supports both parameter-count callbacks and typed parameter/return signatures on every platform. |
| CallbackFree() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Releases a callback created by CallbackCreate on every platform. |
| CaretGetPos() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Retrieves the caret position. If no caret position is available, it returns false and sets both output variables to blank. Linux uses native GTK geometry for script-owned controls and AT-SPI for foreign applications, normalizing Wayland-local coordinates through compositor window geometry when needed. macOS uses the Accessibility API and requires Accessibility permission. |
| Case | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Case branch label used by switch. |
| Catch | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Handles an exception thrown by try/throw. |
| Ceil() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Computes the ceiling value of a number, rounding away from zero for positive numbers, and toward zero for negative numbers. |
| Chr | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns the string (usually a single character) corresponding to the character code indicated by the specified number. |
| Click() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Clicks, holds, releases, wheels, or moves the mouse through the platform input backend and requires InputControl. Wayland requires a supported compositor input backend or keysharp-input; macOS maps InputControl to Accessibility. |
| Clipboard | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Text, image, URI, custom MIME, wait, and change-notification operations use the native platform clipboard backends. See ClipboardAll() for the Wayland multi-format restore limitation. |
| Clipboard.All | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | ⚪ Unknown | The ClipboardAll() save/restore pair as one get/set property. Inherits ClipboardAll()'s Wayland single-representation limitation. |
| Clipboard.Files | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | The copied files as an Array of paths, or "". Windows uses CF_HDROP, everything else text/uri-list. Copy semantics only; cut-vs-copy is desktop-specific and not implemented. |
| Clipboard.Formats / Clipboard.Has() / Clipboard.GetData() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | The platform-native escape hatch. Format names are NOT normalized ("HTML Format"/"FileDrop" on Windows, "text/html"/"text/uri-list" elsewhere), so a script using them is platform-specific by construction. Has() also accepts the portable kind names Text/Image/Files/Html/Rtf. |
| Clipboard.Html / Clipboard.Rtf | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | HTML is exchanged as the fragment: the Windows CF_HTML header is built on write and stripped on read, so the raw envelope is only visible through GetData("HTML Format"). RTF is the format's source text. |
| Clipboard.Image | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | ⚪ Unknown | Gets an Image or ""; the setter takes an Image, file path, bitmap handle or "HBITMAP:n". Replaces CopyImageToClipboard(), which only accepted a filename. Linux is partial: writing works, but reading an image back through Eto/GTK produced no pixbuf under Xvfb and needs a real desktop session to confirm. |
| Clipboard.OnChange() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | Calls Callback(Hook, Type) with 0 (empty), 1 (text or files), or 2 (other); A_EventInfo has the same value. Returns a ClipboardHook and runs independently of OnClipboardChange. Native callbacks are unverified on Linux and macOS. |
| Clipboard.Set() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | ⚪ Unknown | Publishes several formats in one transaction. Windows uses a single raw Win32 transaction, so one change notification; the Eto backends accumulate formats into one offer but publish per entry, so each raises a notification (GTK debounces them into one on Wayland). The Wayland shell-extension fallback can advertise only one MIME type and degrades to the most useful single representation, exactly as ClipboardAll() does there. |
| Clipboard.Text / Clipboard.IsEmpty / Clipboard.Clear() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | Text get/set (identical to A_Clipboard), emptiness and clearing. IsEmpty is derived from the platform format enumeration, so private and registered formats count. macOS is unverified: the Eto/Cocoa backend has never been compiled from the development host. |
| Clipboard.Wait() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | ClipWait with the kind vocabulary added: 0/1 behave exactly as before, and "Text", "Any", "Image", "Files", "Html", "Rtf" are also accepted (by ClipWait too). |
| ClipboardAll() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟢 Full | Captures and restores all advertised clipboard formats on Windows, X11, and macOS. The Wayland extension fallback can restore only one selected MIME representation at a time. |
| ClipCursor() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Confines physical cursor movement to a screen-coordinate rectangle with exclusive right/bottom edges; call without arguments to release. Coordinates ignore CoordMode Mouse. Artificial cursor movement is allowed. Enforcing the boundary observes and suppresses motion, so it requires InputMonitoring and InputControl; releasing it never requests permission. Linux requires keysharp-input and uses suppress-and-warp-back enforcement, so the cursor may briefly cross the boundary. Wayland also requires a compositor backend that can query and move the global cursor. macOS maps the two capabilities to Input Monitoring and Accessibility. |

| ComObjGet() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | ⚪ Unknown | The ComObjGet function returns a reference to an object provided by a COM component. Neither D-Bus nor Apple Events has monikers, so off Windows this behaves as ComObjActive. |
| ComObjQuery() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | ⚪ Unknown | The ComObjQuery function queries a COM object for an interface or service. Selects a D-Bus interface on Linux and a scripting suite on macOS, both of which play the part an IID plays on Windows. |
| ComObjType() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | ⚪ Unknown | The ComObjType function retrieves type information from a COM object. Off Windows the requests differ: Linux answers Name, IID and Path, and macOS answers the class name, Name, CLSID or IID, and Path. |

| Copilot declaration/remap alias | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Keysharp extension: in static hotkey and remap declarations only, `Copilot` lowers to the generic `<#<+F23` chord. When used as a remap source, the firmware-generated LWin and LShift modifiers are released but not restored. It is intentionally not a runtime key name for Hotkey(), Send, KeyWait, GetKeyState, InputHook or related APIs. There is no Office alias. |
| Cos() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Computes the cosine of a number. |
| Cosh() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Computes the hyperbolic cosine of a number. |

| Crypt.CRC32() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Computes the CRC32 checksum of the input as an integer. Crypt.Hash returns the same checksum as hexadecimal. |
| Crypt.Decrypt() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Decrypts what Crypt.Encrypt produced, returning a Buffer. The key, algorithm, mode and encoding must match the ones it was encrypted under. The initialization vector is read from the front of the data unless IV supplies the one Encrypt was given. |
| Crypt.Encrypt() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Encrypts data with a named symmetric cipher, returning a Buffer. Algorithm is AES (the only one so far, named as a parameter so another is a value rather than a new method) and Mode is CBC, ECB, CFB or GCM. GCM authenticates as well as encrypts, so an altered message is detected on decryption instead of decrypting to rubbish; its nonce is 12 bytes and its tag is appended to the result. The chaining modes and GCM are measured byte-identical on Windows and Linux; GCM is not yet run on macOS, where an unsupported platform reports a ValueError rather than failing obscurely. A string Value or Key is taken as its UTF-8 bytes unless another encoding is named. With IV omitted a random one is drawn per call and written in front of the ciphertext, where Crypt.Decrypt reads it back, so the same text does not encrypt alike twice; supply IV only to match a format defined elsewhere, in which case it is not written to the result. The key is used as it stands rather than stretched by a key-derivation function, so derive one with Crypt.PBKDF2 rather than passing a passphrase; under a chaining mode the result carries no authentication tag, where GCM does. |
| Crypt.Hash() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Hashes a String, Buffer, Array of bytes or open File with MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512 or CRC32 (spelled with or without a hyphen), returning uppercase hexadecimal. A File is read as a stream and left at the position it was on. |
| Crypt.HashFile() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Hashes a file, reading it as a stream so that its size does not matter. Takes the same algorithm names as Crypt.Hash. |
| Crypt.MD5() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Computes the MD5 hash of the input. A string is taken as its UTF-8 bytes, so the digest matches the one other tools print for the same text. |
| Crypt.PBKDF2() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Derives key material from a password with PBKDF2, returning a Buffer. This is what makes a passphrase usable as an encryption key, since Crypt.Encrypt otherwise takes the key exactly as given. Algorithm is SHA1, SHA256, SHA384 or SHA512; .NET rejects MD5 for derivation on every platform, so it is not offered. Verified against RFC 6070 on Windows and Linux; not yet run on macOS. |
| Crypt.RandomBytes() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns cryptographically secure random bytes as a Buffer, for an initialization vector, a salt or a key. |
| Crypt.SecureRandom() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Generates a cryptographically secure random number. Returns an integer unless either bound is a float. |
| Crypt.SHA1() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Computes the SHA-1 hash of the input. A string is taken as its UTF-8 bytes, so the digest matches the one other tools print for the same text. |
| Crypt.SHA256() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Computes the SHA-256 hash of the input. A string is taken as its UTF-8 bytes, so the digest matches the one other tools print for the same text. |
| Crypt.SHA384() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Computes the SHA-384 hash of the input. A string is taken as its UTF-8 bytes, so the digest matches the one other tools print for the same text. |
| Crypt.SHA512() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Computes the SHA-512 hash of the input. A string is taken as its UTF-8 bytes, so the digest matches the one other tools print for the same text. |

| DirSelect() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Displays the native folder-selection dialog on every platform. Some legacy Windows folder-dialog option flags have no portable equivalent. |
| DllCall() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Calls a native shared-library function on every platform. Numeric type classes can replace built-in type names, and a 'void' return type yields no value. |
| Download() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Downloads a resource to a file over http, https or ftp, streamed rather than buffered, waiting while pumping so timers and the GUI stay alive. Only the *0 cache flag is supported. An FTP login is anonymous unless the URL carries userinfo credentials, and a directory URL saves the server LIST output. A gopher URL raises a ValueError. |

| FileGetSize() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Retrieves the size of a file. Also allows for passing "t" to return the size in terms of terrabytes. |
| FileGetTime() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Retrieves the datetime stamp of a file or folder. |
| FileGetVersion() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Retrieves the version of a file. Version metadata availability differs by platform file formats. |
| FileInstall() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Extracts the #App Files payload matching Source's canonical script-relative key; otherwise it uses live script-relative FileCopy semantics, and copying onto itself is a no-op. Dest's parent must exist, Overwrite=false atomically preserves existing files, and only the final Files list—not FileInstall calls—selects artifact payloads. |
| FileMove() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Moves or renames one or more files. |
| FileOpen() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Platform statuses inherited from curated 'File and directory operations'; per-function validation pending. An encoding name which cannot be resolved raises a ValueError rather than falling back to another encoding. |
| FileRead() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Retrieves the contents of a file. An encoding name which cannot be resolved raises a ValueError rather than falling back to another encoding. |
| FileRecycle() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | Windows uses the recycle bin and Linux uses the freedesktop Trash through GIO. macOS currently moves only to the user ~/.Trash folder, without per-volume trash or Finder Put Back metadata. |
| FileRecycleEmpty() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | Windows empties the recycle bin and Linux empties the freedesktop Trash through GIO. macOS currently empties only the user ~/.Trash folder, not per-volume trash folders. |
| FileSelect() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Displays the native open/save file dialog, including cancellation and multiple selection, on every platform. |
| FileSetAttrib() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Changes the attributes of one or more files or folders. Wildcards are supported. |
| FileSetTime() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Changes the datetime stamp of one or more files or folders. Wildcards are supported. |
| Finally | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Runs after try/catch regardless of whether an exception occurred. |
| Float() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The Float function converts a numeric string or integer value to a floating-point number. |
| Float32 | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Predefined numeric struct type for typed fields and native calls. |
| Float64 | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Predefined numeric struct type for typed fields and native calls. |
| Floor() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Computes a number rounded down to the nearest integer. Rounds toward zero for positive numbers and away from zero for negative numbers. |
| Font | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | A font as a value object carrying what Gui.SetFont takes, each property optional, plus the platform's Ui/Emoji/GuiDefault/Monospace families. |
| For | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Iterates over enumerable values or key/value pairs. |
| Foreign window management (non-Keysharp apps) | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | On Linux, Control* functions are not supported for foreign apps; use the included AtSpi library for cross-process control interaction. COSMIC supplies native listing, active state, geometry, polling-based events, focus, close, minimize, maximize and restore. wlroots compositors can supply listing, active/state facts and the same actions except geometry. Coordinate hit-testing remains limited without stacking order, and general move/resize is unavailable. macOS currently relies on Accessibility APIs with permission requirements. |
| Format() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Formats text by substituting placeholders with argument values. |
| FormatCs() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Formats text using C#-style format placeholders (1-based indexing adaptation). |
| FormatTime | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Formats a datetime string according to the parameters. All C# formatting options are supported. Supports all V2 functionality except for the Dn and Tn options. If you want to specify a specific format, do it in the format parameter. |
| Func | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Function object type. A callback is passed as a function object, with %"Name"% resolving a name known only at run time to one. |
| Func.IsBuiltIn | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Whether the function object targets a built-in member. |
| Func.IsByRef() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns whether any parameter, or the specified 1-based parameter, is ByRef. |
| Func.IsClosure | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Whether the function object represents a closure over captured locals. |
| Func.IsMethod | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Whether the function object requires a receiver. |
| Func.IsOptional() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns whether any parameter, or the specified 1-based parameter, is optional. |
| Func.IsVariadic | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Whether the target has a variadic trailing parameter. |
| Func.MaxParams | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Maximum number of positional arguments the function object currently accepts. |
| Func.MinParams | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Minimum number of positional arguments the function object currently requires. |
| Func.Params | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Keysharp extension. An Array describing the function's parameters (Name, Index, Optional, ByRef, Variadic, and Default when there is a real one). Reports exactly the names named-argument binding uses, excluding the receiver, internal parameters, and a bound function's already-bound ones. Unset when the parameters cannot be known (ObjBindMethod). |
| FuncObj | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Managed function-object type name accepted by compatibility type checks alongside Func. |
| GetKeyboardLayout() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns a readable platform-native keyboard layout identifier, or an empty string when unavailable. |
| GetKeyInfo() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns layout-aware portable VK, platform-native SC, key name, and modifier information on every platform. |
| GetKeyName() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns the portable name or text of a key from Windows scan codes, Linux evdev codes, or macOS kVK codes. |
| GetKeySC() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns the platform-native physical key code: a Windows scan code, Linux evdev KEY_* code, or macOS kVK code. Returns 0 for a portable key which has no native physical code on that platform. |
| GetKeyState() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns logical, physical, and toggle state. Polling an arbitrary key or mouse button requires InputMonitoring. Modifier state and CapsLock/NumLock/ScrollLock toggle state are ungated; polling whether a lock key is physically down still requires InputMonitoring. Linux uses keysharp-input without installing a hook and fails closed for arbitrary state if its authority is unavailable or revokes access; The keysharp-desktop X11 fallback is limited to ungated modifier and lock-toggle snapshots. Joystick controls (Joy1, JoyX, JoyPOV, JoyName, ...) read the winmm joystick API on Windows and keysharp-input's ungated gamepad path on Linux, which needs neither a grant nor `input` group membership; buttons are numbered as the kernel's joydev driver numbers them and controllers are ordered by device node. macOS has no joystick backend and reports every joystick control as unavailable. |
| GetKeyVK() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns Keysharp's portable Windows-compatible VK for a named key or platform-native physical key code. |
| GetMethod() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The GetMethod function retrieves the implementation function of a method. |
| Global keyboard hooks | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Linux uses evdev/uinput, macOS uses CGEventTap. |
| Global mouse hooks | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Suppression/injection semantics differ by platform. |
| Goto | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Goto doesn't support expressions in Keysharp. |
| GroupActivate() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The GroupActivate function activates the next window in a window group that was defined with the GroupAdd function. |
| GroupAdd() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The GroupAdd function adds a window specification to a window group, creating the group if necessary. |
| GroupClose() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The GroupClose function closes the active window if it was just activated by the GroupActivate or GroupDeactivate function. |
| GroupDeactivate() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The GroupDeactivate function is similar to the GroupActivate function but activates the next window not in the group. |
| Gui control types | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | GUI control types are elements of interaction which can be added to a GUI window using the Gui object's Add method. ActiveX and Custom are Win32-only and raise a ValueError on Linux and macOS; every other type is available on all platforms. ListView additionally supports only the Report view there (see Gui.Add). WebView is backed by whichever browser engine the operating system provides, so what it renders differs by platform (see Gui.WebView), and RichEdit is available everywhere but only the Win32 control serves its whole member surface (see Gui.RichEdit). |
| Gui() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The Gui object provides an interface to create a window, add controls, modify the window, and retrieve information about the window. Such windows can be used as data entry forms or custom user interfaces. |
| Gui.__Enum() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns an enumerator for GUI controls. |
| Gui.__Item | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Indexer property for retrieving controls by name or key. |
| Gui.__New() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Constructs a new GUI window object. |
| Gui.Add() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Adds a control to the GUI. The ActiveX and Custom control types are Win32-only and raise a ValueError on Linux and macOS. A ListView created with a view option other than +Report (+Icon, +IconSmall, +Tile, +List) is not implemented there either. Adding a WebView on Linux fails unless WebKitGTK is installed. |
| Gui.BackColor | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets or sets the GUI background color. |
| Gui.Call() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Shows the GUI when the object is called like a function. |
| Gui.Control.Add() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Adds an item to controls that support item lists. |
| Gui.Control.Choose() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Selects an item in the control. |
| Gui.Control.ClassNN | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | ClassNN identifier of the control. Off Windows only a top-level window reports a ClassNN; a child control returns an empty string, because Eto controls are drawn by the toolkit and have no per-control native window class. |
| Gui.Control.Delete() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Deletes items from controls that support item lists. |
| Gui.Control.Enabled | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets or sets whether the control is enabled. |
| Gui.Control.Focus() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Sets keyboard focus to the control. |
| Gui.Control.Focused | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Whether the control currently has focus. |
| Gui.Control.Font | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | Gets or sets the control's font as a detached Ks.Font snapshot; colour round-trips through ForeColor. |
| Gui.Control.GetPos() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets the control position and size. |
| Gui.Control.Gui | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Parent GUI object for the control. |
| Gui.Control.Hwnd | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Native window handle of the control. |
| Gui.Control.Move() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Moves or resizes the control. |
| Gui.Control.Name | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Associated control name. |
| Gui.Control.OnCommand() | 🟢 Full | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | Registers a WM_COMMAND callback for the control. WM_COMMAND is a Win32 concept; the non-Windows implementation accepts the call, registers nothing and never fires. |
| Gui.Control.OnEvent() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Registers a control event callback. |
| Gui.Control.OnMessage() | 🟢 Full | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | Registers Callback(GuiCtrlObj, wParam, lParam, Msg) to run when the control receives the given window message, ahead of the WM_COMMAND/WM_NOTIFY reflection and default processing. Matches AHK: a non-empty return claims the message (it becomes the reply, the remaining handlers are skipped and default processing is suppressed), while an empty string or no return at all lets the next handler and then default handling run. An explicit 0 therefore claims the message and replies 0. AddRemove is 1 (append, default), -1 (prepend) or 0 (unregister); any other value is a ValueError. Window messages are a Win32 concept, so on Linux and macOS the registration is accepted but no handler is ever invoked. |
| Gui.Control.OnNotify() | 🟢 Full | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | Registers a WM_NOTIFY callback for the control. WM_NOTIFY is a Win32 concept; the non-Windows implementation accepts the call, registers nothing and never fires. |
| Gui.Control.Opt() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Sets options for the control. Changing a ListView to a view other than Report (+Icon, +IconSmall, +Tile, +List) is not implemented on Linux or macOS and raises. Raw Win32 style options (+0x..., +E0x...) have no portable equivalent and are ignored. |
| Gui.Control.Redraw() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Redraws the control. |
| Gui.Control.SetCue() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Sets cue banner (placeholder text) for the control. |
| Gui.Control.SetFont() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Sets the control font. |
| Gui.Control.Text | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets or sets the control text. |
| Gui.Control.ToClr() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The backing toolkit control as a Ks.Clr object. Its concrete type is platform-dependent and unspecified; changes made through it bypass the control's own state and event wiring. |
| Gui.Control.Type | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Control type name. |
| Gui.Control.Value | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets or sets the control value. |
| Gui.Control.Visible | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets or sets whether the control is visible. |
| Gui.Destroy() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Destroys the GUI window and releases associated resources. |
| Gui.Flash() | 🟢 Full | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | Flashes the GUI window to attract attention. Backed by the Win32 FlashWindow API; the call is accepted and does nothing on Linux and macOS. |
| Gui.FocusedCtrl | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Currently focused control in the GUI. |
| Gui.Font | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | Gets or sets the font later controls inherit, as a detached Ks.Font snapshot. |
| Gui.GetClientPos() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets the GUI client-area position and size. |
| Gui.GetPos() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets the GUI window position and size. |
| Gui.Hide() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Hides the GUI window. |
| Gui.Hwnd | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Native window handle of the GUI. |
| Gui.Icon | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | Gets or sets this window's own icon, in place of the tray icon it was created with. Reading returns an Image holding the frame the window shows at its preferred size, or "" when it has none, so an icon can be copied from one window to another. Property form of Gui.SetIcon(). Partial on X11 for the same reasons as the setter. Wayland has no per-window icon protocol and resolves the icon from the window's app id instead; macOS windows have no icon. |
| Gui.MarginX | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Default horizontal margin for layout. |
| Gui.MarginY | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Default vertical margin for layout. |
| Gui.Maximize() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Maximizes the GUI window. |
| Gui.MenuBar | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets or sets the menu bar attached to the GUI. |
| Gui.Minimize() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Minimizes the GUI window. |
| Gui.Move() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟢 Full | Moves and/or resizes the window. On Wayland a client cannot set its own position, so the move is routed through the compositor backend and needs KWin, GNOME or Cinnamon with the Keysharp extension; resizing works everywhere. |
| Gui.Name | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Associated GUI name. |
| Gui.OnEvent() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Registers a GUI event callback. |
| Gui.OnMessage() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | ⚪ Unknown | Registers Callback(GuiObj, wParam, lParam, Msg) to run when the GUI window receives the given window message, ahead of the default window procedure. Matches AHK: a non-empty return claims the message (it becomes the reply, the remaining handlers are skipped and default processing is suppressed), while an empty string or no return at all lets the next handler and then the default window procedure run. An explicit 0 therefore claims the message and replies 0; a non-numeric value claims it and replies 0. AddRemove is 1 (append, default), -1 (prepend) or 0 (unregister); any other value is a ValueError. Off Windows the same synthesized input messages OnMessage() receives are delivered here, after the global monitors have had their turn; see that entry for which messages exist and what is missing. |
| Gui.Opt() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Sets options for the window. Raw Win32 style and extended-style options (+0x..., +E0x...) have no portable equivalent and are ignored on Linux and macOS; the named options are honoured through the toolkit's own properties. The Theme option is unsupported on every platform. +Round rounds the window's outer corners, on Windows 11 only. |
| Gui.Restore() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Restores the GUI window from minimized or maximized state. |
| Gui.RichEdit | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | ⚪ Unknown | The RichEdit control's own members: RichText, SelectedText/SelectedRichText, TextLength, LineCount, Modified, ReadOnly, WordWrap, DetectUrls, HideSelection and Zoom; SelectionStart/SelectionLength, CurrentLine/CurrentCol, FirstVisibleLine, Select, SelectAll and ScrollCaret; GetLine, LineLength, LineFromPos, PosFromLine, PosFromPoint and PointFromPos; CanUndo/CanRedo, Undo, Redo, ClearUndo, Cut, Copy, Paste, Append, Replace and Find; SetFormat/GetFormat, GetBackColor, SetParagraph/GetParagraph and the BeginUpdate/EndUpdate pair a highlighting pass wraps itself in; LoadFile/SaveFile; and the Change, SelectionChange and LinkClick events. Positions are 1-based and index the same text Value returns. Only the Win32 control serves all of it: off Windows there is no undo history, DetectUrls and HideSelection read back as false, Zoom scales the control font, GetFormat reports the start of the range rather than detecting variation, and SelectedRichText, the paragraph pair, the hit-testing pair and FirstVisibleLine raise. GTK has no RTF at all, so RichText and RTF files raise on Linux; colours, fonts and styles work everywhere. |
| Gui.SetFont() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Sets the default font for subsequent controls. |
| Gui.SetIcon() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | Gives one window an icon of its own, from a file, an icon resource in a module, an "HICON:"/"HBITMAP:" handle or an Image, applying to a window which is already open. Every size the source carries is kept, so each place the icon appears takes the one it wants; the Options "Wn" chooses the large (alt-tab and taskbar) size; a source carrying fixed sizes supplies the nearest it holds, one that is resampled anyway lands exactly. Unsupported on Wayland and macOS for the reason given under Gui.Icon. Partial on X11: icon resources inside a module are addressable by name but not by index, and the size option selects the nearest frame the source already carries rather than resampling. |
| Gui.Show() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟢 Full | Displays the window. Explicit X/Y placement on Wayland goes through the compositor backend (KWin, GNOME or Cinnamon with the Keysharp extension) because a client cannot position its own top-level; size, state and centring work everywhere. |
| Gui.Submit() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Submits control values and returns them to script variables. |
| Gui.Tab.UseTab() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Selects the active tab page for subsequent control additions. |
| Gui.Title | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets or sets the GUI window title. |
| Gui.ToClr() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The backing toolkit window as a Ks.Clr object. Its concrete type is platform-dependent and unspecified; changes made through it bypass the Gui's own state and event wiring. |
| Gui.Visible | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets/sets GUI visibility state. |
| Gui.WebView | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | ⚪ Unknown | A browser control with Url, DocumentTitle, CanGoBack/CanGoForward, BrowserContextMenuEnabled and Engine; GoBack, GoForward, Stop, Reload, ExecuteScript, ExecuteScriptAsync, LoadHtml and ShowPrintDialog; and the Navigated, DocumentLoading, DocumentLoaded, DocumentTitleChanged, OpenNewWindow and MessageReceived events. No engine is shipped. Windows prefers Edge through WebView2 when a script asks for it with #Package "Microsoft.Web.WebView2" and falls back to Internet Explorer, where modern pages may not render, the OpenNewWindow URL is recovered from the focused element, and a page cannot post a message before its document has loaded. Linux uses WebKitGTK and needs libwebkit2gtk-4.1 or 4.0 installed or the control cannot be created. |
| GuiCtrlFromHwnd() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The GuiCtrlFromHwnd function retrieves the GuiControl object of a GUI control associated with the specified window handle. |
| GuiFromHwnd() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The GuiFromHwnd function retrieves the Gui object of a GUI window associated with the specified window handle. |
| HasBase() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The HasBase function returns a non-zero number if the specified value is derived from the specified base object. |
| HashMap | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Keysharp-specific map class extending Map without sorted enumeration. |
| HashMap.__New() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Keysharp-specific HashMap constructor (inherits Map methods/properties). |
| HasMethod() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The HasMethod function returns a non-zero number if the specified value has a method by the specified name. |
| HasProp() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The HasProp function returns a non-zero number if the specified value has a property by the specified name. |
| Highlight | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Cross-platform reusable screen-region highlighter built on Overlay. |
| HotIf() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The HotIf and HotIfWin functions specify the criteria for subsequently created or modified hotkey variants and hotstring variants. |
| HotIfWinActive() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Sets hotkey context for active windows. |
| HotIfWinExist() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Sets hotkey context for existing windows. |
| HotIfWinNotActive() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Sets hotkey context for windows that are not active. |
| HotIfWinNotExist() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Sets hotkey context for windows that do not exist. |
| Hotkey() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The Hotkey function creates, modifies, enables, or disables a hotkey while the script is running. |
| Hotkeys/Hotstrings | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Linux and macOS use a suppression-capable global hook, which requires InputMonitoring and InputControl. |
| Hotstring() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The Hotstring function creates, modifies, enables, or disables a hotstring while the script is running. |
| Http | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | HTTP requests, as static shortcuts on a shared stateless client or as a session carrying default headers, credentials and cookies. A non-2xx status is an answer rather than an error. Options: Headers, Body, Json, Timeout (idle, seconds) and OnData per request; BaseUrl, Auth, Proxy, IgnoreCertificateErrors and Handler on a session, where the connection is configured. An unknown option key raises. Each method has an Async twin returning a Task. Download() fetches straight to a file, opened only once the response headers arrive. OnData(Chunk, Received, Total) streams the body and stops the transfer when it returns a non-zero Integer. Session.Close() releases connections, and ToClr() on the session and the response are the escape hatches. |
| Http.Response | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | What a server answered. Headers merges the response and content headers case-insensitively, Text decodes per the response charset, and Body is the raw bytes. Both are empty when OnData took the body. |
| If | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Conditional statement. |
| IL_Add() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Adds an image to an image list, optionally can resize or split the image. |
| IL_Create() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Creates an image list and returns its unique ID. Differs in that it only takes one parameter, LargeIcons, because the first two parameters, InitialCount and GrowCount, have been omitted because C# handles memory internally. |
| IL_Destroy() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Removes an ImageList from the global list of ImageLists. Note, this does not dispose it, it just removes the reference. The garbage collector will handle final disposal when the reference count goes to 0. |
| Image | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Captures, loads, creates, edits and searches images. Search methods return match objects. FromWindow Mode and search Direction use string names instead of numeric codes. Supports saving and CLR bitmap access. Full on Windows, partial on Linux (X11); Wayland and macOS are unverified. |
| ImageSearch() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Searches a screen region for an image, writing the position to ByRef outputs and returning true/false. Only 32-bit color is supported; .ani, .emf, .exif and .wmf files are unsupported. The Keysharp *DirN option uses numeric directions. For searches within an Image, use its Search/SearchAll/SearchPixel methods. |
| Import | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The Import declaration imports a module, or imports names from a module. |
| in | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Membership operator. |
| IndexError | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Built-in error class. |
| IniDelete() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Deletes a value from a standard format.ini file. |
| IniRead() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Reads a value, section or list of section names from a standard format.ini file. |
| IniWrite() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Writes a value or section to a standard format.ini file. |
| InputBox() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The InputBox function displays an input box to ask the user to enter a string. On Linux and macOS the dialog is built with Eto and honours only the Password option; the W, H, X, Y and T (timeout) options are ignored, so Result never returns "Timeout". |
| InputHook() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The InputHook function creates an object which can be used to collect or intercept keyboard input. |
| InputHook.BackspaceIsUndo | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Treats Backspace as undo for collected input. |
| InputHook.BeforeHotkeys | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Whether InputHook receives events before hotkeys process them. |
| InputHook.BufferLengthMax | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Maximum text buffer length before capture ends. |
| InputHook.CaseSensitive | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Whether match checks are case-sensitive. |
| InputHook.EndCharMode | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Whether termination characters remain in collected input. |

| InputHook.OnMouseDown | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Callback invoked on mouse-button press events. |
| InputHook.OnMouseMove | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | OnMouseMove(hook, dx, dy) queues every move report, including (0, 0). Windows derives deltas from desktop-clamped hook positions, so outward movement at an edge can be zero; macOS uses Quartz deltas. Linux requires keysharp-input plus InputMonitoring and InputControl for the suppression-capable callback stream. Relative values are raw device-specific evdev counts, while physical absolute values are changes in normalized [0,65535] axes. Linux A_EventInfo includes DeviceId (0 synthetic, positive physical) and IsAbsolute; synthetic absolute deltas are zero because no relative sample exists. Windows and macOS instead provide global-screen X/Y when available and omit DeviceId; X/Y need not equal the prior position plus dx/dy, and macOS reports the frozen cursor position while movement is suppressed. |
| InputHook.OnMouseUp | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Callback invoked on mouse-button release events. |
| InputHook.Start() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Starts capturing input. Linux and macOS use a suppression-capable global hook, which requires InputMonitoring and InputControl. |

| LoadPicture() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Loads an image, icon or cursor. Differs in that instead of writing to a ref argument, it returns a structure whose fields are Handle and ImageType. |
| Lock | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | A mutual-exclusion lock for code shared between RealThreads: Acquire([Timeout]) and Release(). This is the whole mechanism; the scoped form is ordinary script code around Acquire/Release in a try/finally. Reentrant and owned by a real thread; Acquire blocks that whole real thread. |

| Loop Read | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Reads though a file one line at a time. Optionally supports an output file, which can then be used with FileAppend with no filename argument. An encoding name which cannot be resolved raises a ValueError rather than falling back to another encoding. |

Additionally supports HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA, and an accessor A_LoopRegValue to get the values. Supports data types except the following, which will return UNKNOWN: REG_LINK, REG_RESOURCE_LIST, REG_FULL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR, REG_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS_LIST, REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN. |

| Map.ToClr() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The map as a Ks.Clr object, exposing its full CLR surface late-bound. A Map is itself a CLR IDictionary<object, object>, so .NET APIs declaring one accept it directly. |
| Max() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Computes the larger of two numbers. If either is not numeric, the empty string is returned. The largest value of an array is computed if one is passed in. |

| Menu() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The Menu/MenuBar object provides an interface to create and modify a menu or menu bar, add and modify menu items, and retrieve information about the menu or menu bar. |
| Menu.Add() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Adds an item to a menu. The Right and RTL item options are Win32 menu attributes with no Eto counterpart, so they are parsed and ignored on Linux and macOS; every other option, including the Break/BarBreak column controls, works on all platforms. |
| Menu.AddStandard() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Adds standard tray menu items. |
| Menu.Check() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Checks a menu item. |

| Menu.Handle | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Native menu handle. |
| Menu.Insert() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Inserts an item into a menu. Shares its option parsing with Menu.Add, so the Right and RTL options are likewise ignored on Linux and macOS. |
| Menu.MenuItemCount | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns number of items in a menu. |
| Menu.MenuItemName() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns item text/name for a menu entry. |

| Menu.Show() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Shows the menu at a screen position. |
| Menu.ToClr() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The backing toolkit menu as a Ks.Clr object. Its concrete type is platform-dependent and unspecified; changes made through it bypass Menu's own state and event wiring. |
| Menu.ToggleCheck() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Toggles checked state of a menu item. |
| Menu.ToggleEnable() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Toggles enabled state of a menu item. |

| MenuFromHandle() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The MenuFromHandle function retrieves the Menu or MenuBar object corresponding to a Win32 menu handle. |
| MenuSelect() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The MenuSelect function invokes a menu item from the menu bar of the specified window. Like the Control functions, on Linux and macOS it can only reach menus of windows created by this script, not those of other applications. |
| MethodError | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Built-in error class. |
| Min() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Computes the smaller of two numbers. If either is not numeric, the empty string is returned. The smaller value of an array is computed if one is passed in. |
| Mod() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Computes the remainder when the first number is divided by the second number. Throws an exception if the second number is 0. |
| Modifiers on either term of a custom combination | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Keysharp extension: both terms of a custom combination may carry modifiers (`<^a & b::`, `a & <^b::`). Those on the prefix are tested against the modifiers held when the prefix key went down and kept until it is released, so a key whose firmware asserts modifiers and drops them immediately still works as a prefix; those on the suffix are tested against the live state as the suffix is pressed. A combination asking for neither continues to ignore the modifier state. This covers keyboards whose Copilot key emits LWin+LShift+F23 and whose Office key emits LCtrl+LShift+LAlt+LWin. |
| Monitor | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | Keysharp-specific Ks class for one display: identity and metadata beyond the AHK MonitorGet* functions, plus brightness and DDC/CI control. A Monitor is a snapshot of the topology (call Refresh() to re-read) plus a live handle to the device. On macOS the geometry, identity and change events are verified, but Model and Adapter are always empty (CoreGraphics exposes no product-name or adapter API) and Connection only distinguishes the built-in panel. |
| Monitor.All | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | Every monitor in index order, built from one topology enumeration. Preferred over a loop of Monitor(i), which re-enumerates per monitor and can be shifted by a hotplug midway through. |
| Monitor.Brightness | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Get or set the monitor's brightness as a percentage (0-100). Each access is a real device transaction (tens of milliseconds over DDC/CI) and is deliberately not cached, because the monitor's own buttons can change the value too. Windows uses WMI for the built-in panel and DDC/CI for external monitors. Linux uses the kernel backlight class for the built-in panel (a direct sysfs write where permitted, else logind's SetBrightness) and DDC/CI over /dev/i2c-* for external monitors, which needs i2c-dev loaded and access to the bus (a root install adds a udev rule granting the local-seat user access to display-controller i2c buses only; ddcutil's own rule works too) - hence partial. macOS uses the private DisplayServices framework for the built-in panel and Apple's own displays, and DDC/CI for every other external monitor: on Apple Silicon over the private IOAVService (the only option, since IOFramebuffer does not exist under the DCP architecture), on Intel over the public IOKit I2C API - the Intel path is implemented but untested. Throws an OSError naming the reason where unsupported; test HasBrightness to branch without an exception. |
| Monitor.Connection / .IsInternal / .Adapter | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | How the monitor is attached (HDMI, DisplayPort, eDP, DVI, VGA, Internal, or blank), whether it is a built-in panel, and the adapter driving it. Windows reports the DisplayConfig output technology and the adapter's marketing name; Linux derives the kind from the DRM connector name and reports the DRM driver as the adapter. macOS distinguishes only built-in from external and exposes no adapter name. |
| Monitor.Count | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | The number of monitors; the same value as MonitorGetCount(). |
| Monitor.FromId() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | The monitor whose Id matches, or blank when that monitor is not attached - the lookup that makes a persisted Id useful. Unlike the other factories this must resolve metadata for every attached display, since an id is not part of the topology snapshot. |
| Monitor.FromMouse() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | ⚪ Unknown | The monitor the cursor is on. Cursor position is not permission-gated. On Wayland it is available only when the active compositor or keysharp-input can provide it. |
| Monitor.FromPoint() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | The monitor containing a native screen point, or the nearest monitor when the point lies in a gap. Replaces the removed Ks.MonitorFromPoint() function, which returned an index instead of a Monitor. |
| Monitor.FromWindow() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | ⚪ Unknown | The monitor a window overlaps most. Inherits the platform's foreign-window geometry support, so on Wayland it needs a compositor backend (KWin/GNOME/Cinnamon/COSMIC) to locate the window at all. |
| Monitor.GetVCP() / .SetVCP() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Read or write a raw DDC/CI VCP feature (MCCS): 0x10 brightness, 0x12 contrast, 0x60 input source, 0x62 speaker volume, 0xD6 power mode. GetVCP returns {current, max}. SetVCP drives the monitor's firmware directly - an input-source or power code will switch the monitor away from this computer, and some displays mishandle codes they document, so verify a code against the monitor's MCCS documentation first. SetVCP reads the feature back before writing it, on the transport it already has open, so a code the monitor does not implement raises an OSError instead of reporting a success the display silently ignored - a DDC/CI write is unacknowledged, so that read is the only evidence the code exists. Windows uses dxva2; Linux talks to /dev/i2c-* directly, which needs i2c-dev loaded and bus access (granted by the udev rule a root install adds). macOS reaches external monitors over DDC/CI - the private IOAVService on Apple Silicon, the public IOKit I2C API on Intel (implemented but untested) - and cannot reach the built-in panel at all, which has no DDC/CI connection. |
| Monitor.HasBrightness | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Whether Brightness works for this monitor. This is a real probe of the device rather than a platform guess, so it costs one brightness read. |
| Monitor.Model / .Manufacturer / .Serial / .Id | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | Panel identity from EDID. Id survives reboots and re-plugging and is the value to persist (for example to restore a window layout per monitor set); panels that report no serial are disambiguated by connector, making Id stable per port rather than per panel. Windows reads the EDID Windows cached under the monitor's registry key; Linux reads /sys/class/drm/*/edid under both X11 and Wayland. macOS answers from CoreGraphics vendor/model/serial numbers and has no product-name API, so Model is always blank there. Every field is blank when the display reports nothing. |
| Monitor.OnChange() | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | ⚪ Unknown | ⚪ Unknown | Calls Callback(Hook, Kind) with "Topology" for attachment changes or "Settings" for changes to resolution, position, scale or primary monitor. Returns a MonitorHook; A_EventInfo is the current monitor count. Duplicate notifications with no changes are suppressed. Native callbacks are unverified on Linux and macOS. |
| Monitor.Orientation | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | Clockwise rotation of the desktop content in degrees: 0, 90, 180 or 270. |
| Monitor.PhysicalWidth / .PhysicalHeight / .Dpi | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | The panel's physical size in millimetres, and the resulting dots per inch. Dpi is expressed in the same units as W and H, so it is a physical pixel density on Windows and X11 but a logical one on Wayland and macOS. Blank when the display reports no physical size. |
| Monitor.Primary | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | The primary monitor. |
| Monitor.Refresh() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Updates this monitor in place and returns the same object. Returns blank when detached, preserving the last-known properties. |
| Monitor.RefreshRate | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | Vertical refresh in Hz as a float (59.94, not 59), or blank when unknown. Windows uses the DisplayConfig rational rate, X11 computes it from the RandR mode's pixel clock, Wayland uses wl_output's mode refresh. macOS returns 0 for some built-in panels, which is reported as blank. |
| Monitor.Scale | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The monitor's authored-size scale; 1.0 is 100%. It scales dimensions, never absolute positions. Replaces the removed Ks.MonitorGetScale() function. Wayland and macOS always report 1.0 because their native coordinate spaces already account for UI scaling, so the value only varies on Windows and X11. |
| Monitor.VirtualScreen | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | The union of every monitor - the whole desktop - as an object with X, Y, Width and Height, in native screen coordinates. The origin is negative when a display sits left of or above the primary. |
| Monitor.X / .Y / .Width / .Height / .Bounds / .WorkArea | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | ⚪ Unknown | Geometry in native screen coordinates, the same space MonitorGet reports. Bounds and WorkArea are objects with X, Y, Width and Height. |
| MonitorGet() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns the selected monitor index and writes its native screen-coordinate bounds to the supplied output variables. An omitted index or 0 selects the primary monitor; any other out-of-range index raises a ValueError, matching AutoHotkey v2, rather than silently substituting the primary. Image.FromMonitor() resolves the monitor the same way and inherits that validation. |
| MonitorGetCount() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns the total number of monitors. |
| MonitorGetName() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns the operating system's name of the specified monitor. An out-of-range monitor index raises a ValueError, matching AutoHotkey v2. |
| MonitorGetPrimary() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns the number of the primary monitor. |
| MonitorGetWorkArea() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns the selected monitor index and writes its native screen-coordinate work area to the supplied output variables. An out-of-range monitor index raises a ValueError, matching AutoHotkey v2. |
| MouseClick() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The MouseClick function clicks or holds down a mouse button, or turns the mouse wheel. |
| MouseClickDrag() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The MouseClickDrag function clicks and holds the specified mouse button, moves the mouse to the destination coordinates, then releases the button. |
| MouseGetPos() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Retrieves the current mouse position and, optionally, the window and control beneath it. Cursor coordinates are not permission-gated. Requesting a window or control output requires WindowMonitoring and returns blank when there is no corresponding target. |
| MouseMove() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The MouseMove function moves the mouse cursor. |
| MsgBox() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Displays the specified text in a small window containing one or more buttons. Option values 6, 768, 4096, 8192, 262144 and 16384 are not supported on any platform (there is no help button), and when a timeout or an owner window is used the text is right justified. On Linux and macOS the toolkit offers only the OK, OK/Cancel, Yes/No and Yes/No/Cancel button sets, so button options 2 (Abort/Retry/Ignore), 5 (Retry/Cancel) and 6 (Cancel/Try Again/Continue) are unavailable there and fall back to OK. The four icon options behave the same everywhere. The OK result uses AHK casing on every platform. |
| Named parameters | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Keysharp extension. Binds an argument to the callee's parameter of that name instead of by position; must trail the positional arguments. Works for script functions, built-ins, methods, constructors (built-in classes included: Buffer(ByteCount: 16), Error(Message: msg)), bound functions, COM objects (via IDispatch DISPIDs) and Clr calls (where they also drive overload selection). Not available in '[]' (that is the map literal), and not for the receiver. A call's named arguments travel as one first-class value (Ks.NamedArgs, a case-insensitive Map whose keys are the names; the last argument slot is reserved for it): any variadic parameter collects the ones it does not declare as an ordinary trailing element and a variadic call re-emits it, so a wrapper forwards names without knowing they exist, and NamedArgs(name, value) — imported from the Ks module — makes a named call dynamically; a variadic that consumes its tail as values (Format, Push, Max) receives it as data. See #Warn NamedArg. |
| NormalizeEol() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Normalizes all line endings to a requested or platform-default sequence. |
| not | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Logical NOT operator. |
| Number() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The Number function converts a numeric string to a pure integer or floating-point number. |
| NumGet() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The NumGet function returns the binary number stored at the specified address+offset. A type which does not name a number raises a ValueError, and the name is matched in full where AutoHotkey reads only its first character. |
| NumPut() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The NumPut function stores one or more numbers in binary format at the specified address+offset. A type or value which does not name a number raises a ValueError. |
| ObjAddRef() | 🟢 Full | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | The ObjAddRef and ObjRelease functions increment or decrement an object's reference count. |
| ObjBindMethod() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The ObjBindMethod function creates a BoundFunc object which calls a method of a given object. |
| Object() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Creates a new Object; optional key/value arguments initialize own properties. |
| Object.__Ref() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns a property-reference (PropRef) object. |
| Object.OwnPropCount() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns number of own properties defined directly on the object. |

| ObjGetBase | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Retrieves the value's base object. Differs in that it only returns the name of the base type as a string. |
| ObjGetCapacity() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns the current capacity of the object's internal own-property storage. |
| ObjGetDataPtr() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns the address of the object's structured data (typed properties). |

| ObjPtrAddRef() | 🟢 Full | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | Returns object pointer address and increments its reference count. |
| ObjRelease() | 🟢 Full | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | The ObjAddRef and ObjRelease functions increment or decrement an object's reference count. |
| ObjSetBase() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Sets an object's base object. The native type cannot change and the base chain may not become circular. Neither object may have typed properties, since those fix the memory layout; a prototype which has none is writable. |
| ObjSetCapacity() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Unlike AHK doesn't set the exact capacity, but ensures the internal own props objects can hold the requested number of props. |
| ObjSetDataPtr() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Sets the address of the object's structured data. (Slated for removal in AHK; prefer Struct.At.) |
| OnClipboardChange() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Registers callbacks for native platform clipboard content changes. |
| OnError() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The OnError function registers a function to be called automatically whenever an unhandled error occurs. |
| OnExit() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The OnExit function registers a function to be called automatically whenever the script exits. |
| OnMessage() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | ⚪ Unknown | The OnMessage function registers a function to be called automatically whenever the script receives the specified message. Off Windows there is no native message queue, so the input messages are synthesized from the toolkit events raised by the script's own GUI: WM_MOUSEMOVE, the L/R/M button down, up and double-click messages, WM_MOUSEWHEEL, WM_KEYDOWN/UP, WM_SYSKEYDOWN/UP and WM_CHAR. As on Windows, the callback receives the CONTROL's handle and its thread's last-found window is the GUI the control belongs to. Anything outside that set is never delivered, and messages to windows the script does not own cannot be seen at all. Clicks on a single-line Edit are also missed, because GTK's entry consumes the button press before the toolkit raises its own event, and a press on a window's own background is delivered twice by the native event dispatch and de-duplicated here. Verified on X11 and Wayland; the macOS path shares the code but is untested. |
| or | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Logical OR operator. |
| Ord() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns the numeric two byte unicode value for the first character in a string. This differs from V2 in that it also takes an optional second parameter which specified the 1-based index in the string to return the numeric value for, rather than only doing it for the first character. |
| OSError | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Built-in error class. |
| OutputDebug() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The OutputDebug function sends a string to the debugger (if any) for display. Ks.OutputDebugLine additionally takes a flag to clear the debug output. |
| OutputDebugLine() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Writes a debug line with newline terminator. |
| Overlay | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | ⚪ Unknown | Click-through, always-on-top overlay used by Highlight and ToolTip. Draw through Canvas and publish with Present; SetImage copies an image and Redraw builds a replacement canvas. Pointer events require ClickThrough := false; On GNOME/Cinnamon a click-through overlay is drawn inside the shell, so it is not a window and takes no taskbar entry; frames are transferred as bounded PNG data. Runtime-tested on Windows, covered by automated backing tests on Linux, and unverified on macOS. |
| Parser and runtime execution | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Script execution is provided by Keysharp.Core. Source parsing is an optional Roslyn-free component; lowering and C# compilation are supplied by the optional compiler component. |
| ParseScript() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Parses, lowers, and compilation-validates script text with the optional compiler component. Returns an empty string on success or formatted errors on failure. |
| Pause() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The Pause function pauses the script's current thread or sets the pause state of the underlying thread. |
| Persistent() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The Persistent function prevents the script from exiting automatically when its last thread completes, allowing it to stay running in an idle state. |
| PixelGetColor() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Returns the pixel value at the specified coordinate as a hexadecimal string like 0x010203. Differs because the mode parameter is not supported because it is not needed. |
| PixelSearch() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Searches a region of the screen for a pixel of the specified color. On no match it returns false and sets both output variables to blank. |
| PostMessage() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The PostMessage function places a message in the message queue of a window or control. |
| ProcessClose() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Forces the first matching process to close. |

| RandomSeed() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Sets seed for the pseudo-random generator used by Random(). |
| RealThread | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Represents a real background thread. It carries two separate completions: Task is the entry function's result and settles as the body leaves, while Terminated settles when the OS thread is gone (IsAlive is that as a poll). Post returns a Task; Send runs the work there and blocks. |
| RealThread.Call() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Creates a new real worker thread and runs the callback on it. |
| RealThread.Post() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Queues work on that thread and returns the Task carrying its result: ignore it for fire-and-forget, Then it, or Await it. Queues as a thread launch, so an uninterruptible target defers the work rather than refusing it. |
| RealThread.Task | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The entry function's eventual result, settled as the body leaves rather than when the thread ends, so the value is readable while a worker stays up serving registrations. Errors rethrow when it is awaited. The main and adopted threads have no body and raise TargetError. |
| RealThread.Terminated | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Completes when the OS thread is gone. Reading it asks nothing of the thread; Exit requests shutdown and returns this same task. The main and adopted threads raise TargetError. |
| RegCreateKey() | 🟢 Full | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | The RegCreateKey function creates a registry key without writing a value. |
| RegDelete | 🟢 Full | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | Deletes a value from the registry. |
| RegDeleteKey() | 🟢 Full | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | Deletes a key from the registry. |

| Reload() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The Reload function replaces the currently running instance of the script with a new one. |
| RequestCapabilities() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Requests or queries the eight canonical platform permissions and returns each status: InputMonitoring, InputControl, WindowMonitoring, WindowControl, ScreenCapture, AudioCapture, CameraCapture, and ClipboardMonitoring. Linux requires keysharp-input for InputMonitoring and keysharp-desktop for the desktop scopes; either helper can manage the shared InputControl grant. On macOS, WindowMonitoring reflects both Accessibility and Screen Recording because foreign window titles require both; WindowControl maps to Accessibility. AudioCapture and CameraCapture are requestable Linux scopes but no current capture operation consumes them. |
| Return | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns from a function/subroutine, optionally with a value. |
| Round() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Computes a number rounded to either the nearest integer, a specified number of decimal places, or a specified number of digits. |
| RTrim() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Trims characters from the beginning of a string. |
| Run() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Run and RunWait launch an external program; RunWait waits for it to finish. A successful call which has no process identifier sets a requested PID output to blank. |
| RunAs() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Specifies a set of user credentials to use for all subsequent uses of Run and RunWait. |
| RunScript() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Executes script source text/file in a script engine context. Requires the optional compiler component at runtime; compiled artifacts detect this call and include the component unless it is explicitly excluded. |
| RunWait() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The Run and RunWait functions run an external program. RunWait will wait until the program finishes before continuing. |
| Screen capture and pixel/image functions | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Pixel/image search and screen capture depend on platform-specific backends. On Linux, keysharp-desktop provides authorized X11, Wayland compositor, and portal capture. |
| Script-owned window management | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Creating and driving the script's own GUI windows. Built on WinForms (Windows) and Eto (Linux/macOS); the object model, events, controls, menus, ListView and TreeView all behave the same. Remaining differences: the ActiveX and Custom control types are Win32-only, ListView supports only the Report view off Windows, raw Win32 style options are ignored, the WebView control renders with whichever browser engine the platform provides, per-monitor DPI re-layout is Windows-only, and a client cannot position its own window on Wayland without a compositor backend. |
| Send() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Sends simulated keystrokes. |
| SendEvent() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Sends keystrokes via Event mode. |

| SendMode() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Sets the default send mode. "Play" has no journal-playback equivalent on Linux or macOS and is downgraded to "Event" with a one-time warning to stderr; Input and Event behave as documented. |
| SendPlay() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Sends keystrokes via Play mode. Play mode depends on the Win32 journal-playback hook, which has no equivalent elsewhere: Linux and macOS silently downgrade to Event mode and print a one-time warning to stderr. |
| SendText() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Sends text without translating key names. |
| SetCapsLockState() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The SetCapsLockState, SetNumLockState and SetScrollLockState functions set the state of the corresponding key. Can also force the key to stay on or off. |
| SetControlDelay() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The SetControlDelay function sets the delay that will occur after each control-modifying function. |
| SetDefaultMouseSpeed() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The SetDefaultMouseSpeed function sets the mouse speed that will be used if unspecified in Click, MouseMove, MouseClick and MouseClickDrag. |
| SetKeyDelay() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The SetKeyDelay function sets the delay that will occur after each keystroke sent by the Send or ControlSend functions. |

| SetScrollLockState() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The SetCapsLockState, SetNumLockState and SetScrollLockState functions set the state of the corresponding key. Can also force the key to stay on or off. |
| SetStoreCapsLockMode() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The SetStoreCapsLockMode function determines whether to restore the state of the CapsLock key after a Send function. |
| SetTimer() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The SetTimer function causes a function to be called automatically and repeatedly at a specified time interval. |
| SetTitleMatchMode() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The SetTitleMatchMode function sets the matching behavior of the WinTitle parameter in built-in functions such as WinWait. |
| SetWinDelay() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The SetWinDelay function sets the delay that will occur after each windowing function, such as WinActivate. |

| Shutdown() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | Shuts down, restarts, or logs off the system. macOS uses System Events; its normal actions are implemented, but AHK's force flag has no direct equivalent and is ignored with a diagnostic. |
| Sin() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Computes the hyperbolic sine of a number. |
| Sinh() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Computes the hyperbolic sine of a number. |
| Sleep() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The Sleep function waits the specified amount of time before continuing. |
| Sort() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Arranges a variable's contents in alphabetical, numerical, or random order (optionally removing duplicates). The back slash option also supports specifying a forward slash / so it can be used for paths on non-Windows systems. |
| Sound APIs | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Audio device/endpoint support differs by platform. These are the AutoHotkey-compatible functions; the Keysharp-only Ks.Audio class adds polyphonic playback, exact device selection, per-application sessions and recording alongside them. |
| SoundBeep() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Emits a tone at the requested frequency and duration on every platform. Windows uses the Win32 Beep API. Linux and macOS synthesize the sine wave to an in-memory WAV and play it through the same backend as SoundPlay, so Frequency and Duration are honoured there too; Linux needs one of the players listed under SoundPlay to be installed. |
| SoundGetInterface() | 🟢 Full | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | Retrieves a native COM interface of a sound device or component and is Windows-specific. |
| SoundGetMute() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟢 Full | Retrieves a mute setting of a sound device. Differs in that there is no support for components, so the function only takes one parameter: the 1-based index, or name for the device. Platform statuses inherited from curated 'Sound APIs'; per-function validation pending. |
| SoundGetName() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟢 Full | Retrieves the name of a sound device. Differs in that there is no support for components, so the function only takes one parameter: the 1-based index, or name for the device. Platform statuses inherited from curated 'Sound APIs'; per-function validation pending. |
| SoundGetVolume() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟢 Full | Retrieves a mute setting of a sound device. Differs in that there is no support for components, so the function only takes one parameter: the 1-based index, or name for the device. Platform statuses inherited from curated 'Sound APIs'; per-function validation pending. |
| SoundPlay() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Plays a sound file. The "*n" standard-sound syntax (*-1, *16, *32, *48, *64) works on every platform: Windows passes the number to MessageBeep, Linux uses the freedesktop sound theme and macOS /System/Library/Sounds, the latter two falling back to a synthesized beep when the desktop ships no such sound. Windows plays via MCI, so any format with an installed codec works (.wav, .mp3, .avi, ...); MCI limits paths to roughly 127 characters. macOS uses afplay (wav/aiff/caf/mp3/m4a). Linux picks the best installed player for the file type - paplay or aplay for uncompressed/libsndfile formats, otherwise ffplay, mpv, gst-play-1.0 or mpg123 - and raises an error naming them if none is present. On every platform, starting a new file stops the previous one, SoundPlay on a nonexistent file stops playback and raises, and playback stops when the script exits. |
| SoundSetMute() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟢 Full | Changes a mute setting of a sound device. Differs in that there is no support for components, so the function only takes one parameter: the 1-based index, or name for the device. Platform statuses inherited from curated 'Sound APIs'; per-function validation pending. |
| SoundSetVolume() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟢 Full | Changes a volume setting of a sound device. Differs in that there is no support for components, so the function only takes one parameter: the 1-based index, or name for the device. Platform statuses inherited from curated 'Sound APIs'; per-function validation pending. |
| SplitPath() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Separates a file name or URL into its name, directory, extension, and drive. Differs in that instead of writing to ref arguments, it returns a structure whose fields are what the original input parameter names would have been. |
| Sqrt() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Computes the square root of a number. Throws an exception if the argument is negative. |
| StatusBarGetText() | 🟢 Full | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | Retrieves text from a native Win32 status bar control. No non-Windows status-bar accessibility backend is implemented. |
| StatusBarWait() | 🟢 Full | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | Waits for native Win32 status-bar text and depends on StatusBarGetText; no non-Windows status-bar accessibility backend is implemented. |
| StrCompare() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Compares two strings alphabetically. Note this supports local, human readable comparison as well. |
| StrGet() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Copies a string from a memory address or buffer, optionally converting it from a given code page. An encoding name which cannot be resolved raises a ValueError rather than falling back to another encoding. |
| String() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Converts a value to a string. For an object, the result is whatever its ToString() returned, so a ToString() which returns no value makes String() return no value too rather than raising. |
| String.EndsWith() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns whether a string ends with the specified suffix. The CaseSense parameter matches InStr; comparisons are culture-invariant unless the Locale option is given. |
| String.StartsWith() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns whether a string starts with the specified prefix. The CaseSense parameter matches InStr; comparisons are culture-invariant unless the Locale option is given. |
| StringBuffer() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Creates a mutable string buffer object. |
| StrLen() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Retrieves the count of how many characters are in a string. |
| StrLower() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Converts a string to lowercase. |
| StrPtr() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The StrPtr function returns the current memory address of a string. |
| StrPut() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Writes string data to a buffer/address using specified encoding. An encoding name which cannot be resolved raises a ValueError rather than falling back to another encoding. |
| StrReplace() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Replaces occurrences of a substring and returns the updated string. |
| StrSplit() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Retrieves one or more characters from the specified position in a string. |
| StrTitle() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The StrLower, StrUpper and StrTitle functions convert a string to lowercase, uppercase or title case. |

| structures | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | User-defined structures via the struct keyword: typed fields, nesting, At, numeric types, pointer classes, #StructPack alignment, and structured arrays (Int32[10] / Struct.Array). |
| StrUpper() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Converts a string to uppercase. |
| SubStr() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Retrieves one or more characters from the specified position in a string. |
| super | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Keyword that accesses base-class methods and properties. |
| Suspend() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The Suspend function disables or enables all or selected hotkeys and hotstrings. |
| Switch | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Selects one case branch based on a value/expression. |
| SysGet() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Gets system information. Non-Windows builds implement monitor dimensions/count, mouse presence/buttons, network state and selected session metrics; Win32-only system metrics have no portable equivalent and are not implemented. |
| SysGetIPAddresses() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The SysGetIPAddresses function returns an array of the system's IPv4 addresses. |
| TabControl.SetTabIcon() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Sets icon for a tab page in tab controls. |
| Tan() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Computes the tangent of a number. |
| Tanh() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Computes the hyperbolic tangent of a number. |
| TargetError | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Built-in error class. |
| Task | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Work that finishes later; every CLR call returning a .NET Task hands one back. Status is the canonical one-read state (Pending/Succeeded/Failed/Canceled) with IsPending/IsSucceeded/IsFailed/IsCanceled as single-question predicates, Result is a non-blocking snapshot, Await returns or throws the outcome, and Wait returns false only on timeout. Then receives the successful value, can optionally handle failure, adopts the selected callback's returned work, and propagates cancellation. WhenAny transfers the first value, failure or cancellation. |
| Task.Create() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Calls Producer synchronously with the positional prefix it accepts of Succeed, Fail and Cancel, and returns the Task they settle; Producer's return value is ignored. First settlement wins; Succeed adopts asynchronous work's eventual value, failure or cancellation, and an early producer error fails the Task. |
| Task.ToClr() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The underlying CLR task as a Ks.Clr object, so members Task does not mirror (IsCompleted, ContinueWith, ...) stay reachable. Replaces the former Clr property. |
| Taskbar | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Draws a badge and a progress bar on one window's taskbar button (SetBadge, SetProgress, SetProgressState). Called on the class it decorates the application's own button and every window opened afterwards, which is what Linux and macOS do in any case; constructed with a window handle it decorates that one button, a distinction only Windows makes. HasBadgeIcon/IsPerWindow report what the platform can draw. Windows uses ITaskbarList3, per window. Linux uses the Unity LauncherEntry protocol, which carries a number rather than an icon, covers the whole application, and decorates the desktop entry selected by DESKTOP_ENTRY, then #App DesktopEntry, then Keysharp. Plasma and implementing docks consume it natively; the keysharp-desktop extension maps it onto GNOME's stock overview dash and Cinnamon's grouped-window-list. macOS badges the dock tile with text and draws progress on the tile, also application-wide. Cinnamon 6.6.9 is runtime-verified; GNOME, Plasma and macOS are compile-checked or source-verified only. |
| Thread | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Thread settings and controls. |
| Thread (object) | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Thread is a class rather than a function: calling it runs the AHK sub-functions (NoTimers/Priority/Interrupt) unchanged, and an instance describes one pseudo-thread: Id, Index (1-based), IsActive, Kind, Elapsed, Priority, Critical, Paused, IsInterruptible, Underlying and Exit. An Is prefix marks a read-only predicate; a settable mode is named for the mode. Obtained from A_Thread, Under or RealThread.Threads, never constructed. There is one object per pseudo-thread, so `thr == A_Thread` tests whether it is the running one. It revalidates its identity on every access, so one held past its pseudo-thread's life reports IsActive false rather than describing whichever pseudo-thread reused the pooled slot. Reads work from any real thread; setters and Exit require the owning one. |
| Throw | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Rethrowing with throw is only allowed directly within the scope of catch, not from an arbitrary point (eg from functions). |
| TimeoutError | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Built-in error class. |
| ToolTip() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟢 Full | Creates an always-on-top window anywhere on the screen. On Linux and macOS it is drawn with the cross-platform Overlay primitive rather than a native tooltip, which on Wayland needs a compositor the Overlay supports (KWin, GNOME, or Cinnamon with the Keysharp extension). |
| Tray icon and menu | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Tray icon, its menu and TrayTip notifications. On Linux the tray depends on the desktop providing a StatusNotifier/AppIndicator host - some environments need an extension before an icon appears at all - and notifications go through the desktop notification service. macOS uses a status item in the menu bar. |
| TraySetIcon() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Changes the script's tray icon. |
| TrayTip() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Creates a toast message window near the tray icon. Differs in that the Mute option is accepted but has no effect (there is no way to mute the system sound) and a large icon cannot be requested. The registry key EnableBalloonTips is not observed for disabling the notification. The option 4 has no effect because the tray icon is always shown at the top of the toast. On Linux and macOS the toast is an Eto Notification, so its appearance and duration are decided by the desktop notification service. |
| TreeView.Add() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Adds an item to a TreeView. |
| TreeView.Delete() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Deletes one item or all items in a TreeView. |
| TreeView.Get() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets state information for a TreeView item. |
| TreeView.GetChild() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets the first child item of a TreeView node. |
| TreeView.GetCount() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets the total item count in a TreeView. |
| TreeView.GetNext() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets the next sibling item in a TreeView. |
| TreeView.GetNode() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Returns TreeView node object by node id/handle. |
| TreeView.GetParent() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets the parent item of a TreeView node. |
| TreeView.GetPrev() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets the previous sibling item in a TreeView. |
| TreeView.GetSelection() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets the currently selected TreeView item. |
| TreeView.GetText() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets text of a TreeView item. |
| TreeView.Modify() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Changes TreeView item text, icon, or state. |
| TreeView.SetImageList() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Assigns an image list for TreeView icons. |
| Trim() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Trims characters from the beginning and end of a string. |
| True | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Boolean true constant. |
| Try | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Starts exception-handling scope for statements that may throw. |
| Type | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The Type function returns the class name of a value. |
| TypeError | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Built-in error class. |
| UInt16 | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Predefined numeric struct type for typed fields and native calls. |
| UInt32 | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Predefined numeric struct type for typed fields and native calls. |
| UInt8 | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Predefined numeric struct type for typed fields and native calls. |
| UnsetError | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Built-in error class. |
| UnsetItemError | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Built-in error class. |
| Until | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Loop-until condition syntax for terminating a loop when condition becomes true. |
| Url | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Percent-encoding. Encode escapes everything outside the RFC 3986 unreserved set, per byte, with a space becoming %20 rather than +. Decode resolves the escapes and leaves a lone % and a + as themselves. |
| ValueError | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Built-in error class. |
| VarSetStrCapacity() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Does nothing because the.NET runtime manages all memory. |
| VerCompare() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The VerCompare function compares two version strings. |
| While | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | While-loop statement. |
| WinActivate() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinActivate function activates the specified window. |
| WinActivateBottom() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinActivateBottom function is similar to the WinActivate function but it activates the bottommost matching window rather than the topmost. |
| WinActive() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinActive function checks if the specified window is active and returns its unique ID (HWND). |
| WinClose() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinClose function closes the specified window. |
| WinEvent | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Keysharp-specific Ks class for cross-platform window-event subscriptions. Windows uses SetWinEventHook; Linux uses keysharp-desktop X11 or native compositor sources; macOS uses Accessibility AXObserver streams and requires Accessibility permission. |
| WinEvent.Active() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Subscribes to active/foreground window changes; also fires when the active window's title changes (so late-matching criteria are caught). Callback receives (hook, hwnd, dwmsEventTime). |
| WinEvent.CaretMove() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Subscribes to text caret (insertion point) movement. hwnd is the caret owner's top-level window and A_EventInfo holds the caret rectangle { X, Y, Width, Height } in screen coordinates; unchanged positions are suppressed. Sourced from the same accessibility plumbing as CaretGetPos, so coverage matches it: Windows uses the MSAA caret (EVENT_OBJECT_LOCATIONCHANGE on OBJID_CARET), Linux the AT-SPI object:text-caret-moved signal, macOS the AXSelectedTextChanged notification. Applications that draw their own caret without exposing it to accessibility report nothing. |
| WinEvent.Count | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Remaining number of times the callback will fire (-1 = unlimited). |
| WinEvent.EventType | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | The event kind this subscription listens for, e.g. "Active" or "Move". |
| WinEvent.Exist() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Subscribes to a matching window appearing (created, shown, or its title changed so it now matches); fires once per matching window and respects DetectHiddenWindows. Subsumes the reference library's Create. macOS uses per-application AXObserver streams and requires Accessibility permission. |
| WinEvent.IsActive | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Whether the subscription is still receiving events. |
| WinEvent.Minimize() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Subscribes to window minimize/iconify. |
| WinEvent.Move() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Subscribes to window move/resize. Every event is delivered as-is (not coalesced). |
| WinEvent.NotExist() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Subscribes to a matching window disappearing (destroyed, hidden/cloaked, or its title changed so it no longer matches). Subsumes the reference library's Close. Tracks the set of matching top-level windows while they are alive (mirroring the reference library) so it fires reliably even though the window may be gone by the time the event arrives. |
| WinEvent.Pause() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Pauses (1), unpauses (0) or toggles (-1) a single hook (instance) or all hooks (static). A paused hook stays registered but does not fire. Returns the resulting paused state. |
| WinEvent.Paused | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Gets or sets whether a single hook (instance) or all hooks (static) are paused. |
| WinEvent.Restore() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Subscribes to restoration from a minimized state. X11 derives it from _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN transitions, Wayland maps compositor restore events, and macOS uses AXWindowDeminiaturized. |
| WinEvent.Stop() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Cancels the subscription. Also runs on __Delete, but GC timing is unpredictable so call it (or let the owning thread tear down) explicitly. |
| WinEvent.TitleChange() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Subscribes to window title changes. |
| WinExist() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinExist function checks if the specified window exists and returns the unique ID (HWND) of the first matching window. |
| WinFromPoint() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Returns the window handle at screen coordinates and requires WindowMonitoring. Omitting the coordinates uses the current cursor position, which is not separately permission-gated. |
| WinGetAlwaysOnTop() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinGetAlwaysOnTop function returns a non-zero value if the specified window is always-on-top. On macOS, only supported for windows owned by the calling process; always returns false for windows owned by other applications. |
| WinGetClass() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinGetClass function retrieves the specified window's class name. |
| WinGetClientPos() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinGetClientPos function retrieves the position and size of the specified window's client area. |
| WinGetControls() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Returns the ClassNN of the controls in a window. Off Windows only windows created by this script have real controls; for a foreign application X11 enumerates child X windows (which a client-side-drawn GTK/Qt app does not have), and Wayland and macOS report none. Use the bundled AtSpi (Linux) or Ax (macOS) library for cross-process control access. |
| WinGetControlsHwnd() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Returns the window handles of the controls in a window. Off Windows only windows created by this script have real controls; for a foreign application X11 enumerates child X windows (which a client-side-drawn GTK/Qt app does not have), and Wayland and macOS report none. Use the bundled AtSpi (Linux) or Ax (macOS) library for cross-process control access. |
| WinGetCount() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinGetCount function returns the number of existing windows that match the specified criteria. |
| WinGetEnabled() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🔴 Unsupported | Retrieves the enabled/disabled state of the specified window. On macOS this always reflects whether the window exists, not its true enabled state, since there is no API to query it. |
| WinGetExStyle() | 🟢 Full | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | Retrieves the extended style of the specified window. Neither X11, Wayland nor macOS has an equivalent of Win32 extended window styles; all three always return 0. |
| WinGetID() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinGetID function returns the unique ID (HWND) of the specified window. Wayland foreign windows receive positive process-local synthetic handles which can be reused with ahk_id and other window functions. |
| WinGetIDLast() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinGetIDLast function returns the unique ID (HWND) of the last/bottommost window if there is more than one match. |
| WinGetList() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinGetList function returns an array of unique IDs (HWNDs) for all existing windows that match the specified criteria. Wayland foreign-window IDs are positive process-local synthetic handles. |
| WinGetMinMax() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinGetMinMax function returns a non-zero number if the specified window is maximized or minimized. |
| WinGetPID() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinGetPID function returns the Process ID (PID) of the specified window. |
| WinGetPos() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinGetPos function retrieves the position and size of the specified window. |
| WinGetProcessName() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinGetProcessName function returns the name of the process that owns the specified window. |
| WinGetProcessPath() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinGetProcessPath function returns the full path and name of the process that owns the specified window. |
| WinGetStyle() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Retrieves the style of the specified window. No non-Windows platform has a real Win32 style word, so for a script-owned window the toolkit state is projected onto the WS_* bits scripts actually test: WS_CAPTION/WS_POPUP from the border style, WS_SYSMENU, WS_THICKFRAME, WS_MINIMIZEBOX and WS_MAXIMIZEBOX from the frame buttons, plus WS_VISIBLE, WS_DISABLED, WS_MINIMIZE and WS_MAXIMIZE from the window state. Foreign windows expose no native Win32 style word: X11 and Wayland report WS_CAPTION from decoration state, and macOS returns 0. |
| WinGetText | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Retrieves the text from a window. On X11 the text is gathered by walking the X window tree and reading each child's WM_NAME, so a modern GTK or Qt application - whose widgets are drawn client-side and are not X windows - yields little or nothing. Wayland exposes no window text at all and returns empty; macOS reads it through the Accessibility API. |
| WinGetTitle() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinGetTitle function retrieves the title of the specified window. |
| WinGetTransColor() | 🟢 Full | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | Retrieves the transparency colour key of the specified window. No non-Windows backend implements a per-colour transparency key; X11, Wayland and macOS always return 0. |
| WinGetTransparent() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟢 Full | The WinGetTransparent function returns the degree of transparency of the specified window. |
| WinHide() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinHide function hides the specified window. On macOS, windows owned by the calling process are hidden individually; for windows owned by other applications, macOS provides no per-window hide API, so the entire owning application is hidden instead. |
| WinKill() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinKill function forces the specified window to close. On Wayland a real force-kill is provided by the Keysharp GNOME or Cinnamon shell extension (compositor-dependent), falling back to a graceful close request. |
| WinMaximize() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinMaximize function enlarges the specified window to its maximum size. |
| WinMaximizeAll() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | Maximizes all top-level windows. |
| WinMinimize() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinMinimize function collapses the specified window into a button on the task bar. |
| WinMinimizeAll() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinMinimizeAll and WinMinimizeAllUndo functions minimize or unminimize all windows. |
| WinMinimizeAllUndo() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinMinimizeAll and WinMinimizeAllUndo functions minimize or unminimize all windows. |
| WinMove() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinMove function changes the position and/or size of the specified window. |
| WinMoveBottom() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinMoveBottom function sends the specified window to the bottom of stack; that is, beneath all other windows. On Wayland this is provided by the Keysharp KWin provider or the GNOME/Cinnamon shell extension (compositor-dependent). On macOS, only supported for windows owned by the calling process, via NSWindow.orderBack(); macOS provides no API to lower another process's window. |
| WinMoveTop() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟢 Full | The WinMoveTop function brings the specified window to the top of the stack without explicitly activating it. On Wayland this is provided natively on KWin (compositor scripting) or by the Keysharp GNOME or Cinnamon shell extension (compositor-dependent). On macOS this is done via the Accessibility AXRaise action, which raises the window within its owning application without activating that application. |
| WinRedraw() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🔴 Unsupported | Redraws a window. Own windows are invalidated through the toolkit on every platform. For a foreign window X11 approximates it with XClearWindow, Wayland has no equivalent and raises an OSError, and macOS reports success without doing anything because AppKit owns repainting. |
| WinRestore() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinRestore function unminimizes or unmaximizes the specified window if it is minimized or maximized. |
| WinSetAlwaysOnTop() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinSetAlwaysOnTop function makes the specified window stay on top of all other windows (except other always-on-top windows). On macOS, only supported for windows owned by the calling process; macOS provides no API to change another process's window level, and raising it via Accessibility would require repeatedly stealing focus, so it is a no-op for windows owned by other applications. |
| WinSetEnabled() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🔴 Unsupported | Enables or disables the specified window. Linux supports script-owned windows, but neither X11 nor Wayland has a faithful equivalent of Win32 EnableWindow for another application's window, so a foreign target raises OSError. macOS has no faithful public equivalent and is intentionally unsupported. |
| WinSetExStyle() | 🟢 Full | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | Changes the extended style of the specified window. Neither X11, Wayland nor macOS has an equivalent of Win32 extended window styles. On a script-owned window the call is accepted and does nothing; on a foreign window it raises an OSError. |
| WinSetRegion() | 🟢 Full | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | The WinSetRegion function changes the shape of the specified window to be the specified rectangle, ellipse, or polygon. This is implemented purely via the Win32 GDI region APIs (HRGN/SetWindowRgn) and is Windows-only; non-rectangular window shaping has no equivalent implementation on Linux or macOS. |
| WinSetStyle() | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | 🔴 Unsupported | Changes the style of the specified window. X11 and Wayland map WS_CAPTION to the desktop provider decoration state for foreign windows; other native Win32 style bits have no equivalent. Script-owned windows use toolkit behavior. macOS has no equivalent. |
| WinSetTitle() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinSetTitle function changes the title of the specified window. On Wayland, script-owned titles can be changed but no supported compositor backend exposes title mutation for another application, so a foreign target raises OSError. On macOS, windows owned by the calling process have their title set directly; for windows owned by other applications, setting AXTitle via the Accessibility API is attempted, but most applications treat it as read-only and the call has no effect. |
| WinSetTransColor() | 🟢 Full | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | 🔴 Unsupported | Makes all pixels of the chosen colour invisible. No non-Windows backend implements a per-colour transparency key; X11, Wayland and macOS raise an OSError. Whole-window opacity via WinSetTransparent is supported instead. |
| WinSetTransparent() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinSetTransparent function makes the specified window semi-transparent. On Wayland this is provided natively on KWin (compositor scripting) or by the Keysharp GNOME or Cinnamon shell extension (compositor-dependent). On macOS, only supported for windows owned by the calling process, via NSWindow.alphaValue; macOS provides no public API to change another process's window opacity. |
| WinShow() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟡 Partial | The WinShow function unhides the specified window. On macOS, windows owned by the calling process are restored individually; for windows owned by other applications, the entire owning application is unhidden (the inverse of WinHide's fallback). |
| WinWait() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟢 Full | The WinWait function waits until the specified window exists. |
| WinWaitActive() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟢 Full | The WinWaitActive and WinWaitNotActive functions wait until the specified window is active or not active. |
| WinWaitClose() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟢 Full | The WinWaitClose function waits until no matching windows can be found. |
| WinWaitNotActive() | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟡 Partial | 🟢 Full | The WinWaitActive and WinWaitNotActive functions wait until the specified window is active or not active. |
| ZeroDivisionError | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | 🟢 Full | Built-in error class. |
