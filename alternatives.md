This document serves as a high level analysis of the various tools other than AHK/Keysharp for desktop automation.

As is shown here, there are many alternatives, hobby projects and even full fledged commercial software for hotkeys, text expansion and general automation.

It would serve no valuable purpose to create yet another experimental project. Instead, Keysharp aims to extend well known Windows-only functionality to linux.

##espanso##
	+ Description: A cross platform text expander.
	+ Platform(s): Windows, linux & Mac.
	+ Language: Rust
	+ Implementation methodology: Reads devices directly and uses some X11 xkb functions. Borrows code from https://github.com/xkbcommon/libxkbcommon/blob/master/tools/interactive-evdev.c
	+ Dependencies:
